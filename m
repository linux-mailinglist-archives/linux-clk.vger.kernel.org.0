DE33 has introduced "shared" planes, which can be allocated to any mixer. T=
hey
have now distinct memory region and are not included in mixer regions anymo=
re
as it was the case with DE2 and DE3. This patchset maps whole planes region=
 to
mixer0 which was a hack to get quick result and to push problem to a later =
time,
which is obviously now.

I see two solutions:
1. All mixers map same region for planes. Not sure if this is acceptable, b=
ut it's
    far the easiest to implement (already done).
2. Implement separate plane driver. Each mixer would have phandle to plane =
node
    and could call plane management functions there, like switch plane crtc=
=2E This
    to me sounds like a better solution.

What do you think?
