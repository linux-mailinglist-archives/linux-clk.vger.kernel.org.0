Thank you for the explanation think I am starting to get there.

There is a slight error in the commit message there I think, the
change doesn't affect clk_mux_determine_rate_flags which still
calls clk_core_get_parent_by_index so will still do the full
lookup. It looks like it affects clk_calc_new_rates instead.

Which I guess does raise the question would an optimisation on
the determine_rate path help these power issues as well?

Yeah that seems to be what is happening in my case. As best I
can figure out so far, this relates to our clocks not having
any rate setting capabilities, as it looks like most of the
cache population comes from those paths.

This part does fix my issue. Is there a reason not to update
core->parents[i].core on this path?

Thanks,
Charles
