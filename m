Hello Stephen,

I took some minutes to look at this again, because I was the one who had 
difficulties understanding the documentation here in the first place.

Note: this patch/discussion is not about changing the dt-binding, but about 
improving the documentation on the properties 'assigned-clocks', 'assigned-
clock-parents', and 'assigned-clock-rates'. See below:

This was indeed one source of confusion for me. This obfuscation of Uwe would 
have helped me, because it hides distracting information, which is irrelevant 
for explaining assigned clock parents and might lead to false conclusions on 
how those things work.

Reordering might not help. What helps on understanding things is describing 
the same topic in a different way again. This is somewhat redundant, but 
someone who does not fully understand explanation A might understand 
explanation B better.

I could go with that and send a v3 with the obfuscation from above (I'd like 
to keep that) and this paragraph of yours?
