The device will get suspended (like you say) till the first usage, which
will resume it and thus make the clock enabled.

In general you need runtime PM to make a proper clock driver. You can
skip it, just like most of our early drivers skipped it, including
Exynos7, but it's not good in the long run. You might later hit for
example imprecise aborts when enumerating clocks (/sys/kernel/debug/clk)
or power domains.

To me it is fine with skipping runtime PM, but using platform driver now
seems good choice. When writing the code, use rather Exynos5433 as an
example, not Exynos7. The former was extensively developed and used for
mainline. The latter was only part of rather early bringup of platform
and lacks several features/drivers/DT.
