I see. I'll add more detailed summary.

Yes, I need to make BCLK as a critical only for specific platforms. BCLK
is for controllers that are connected through PCI or PCIe bus to the
host machine such as VGA controller, 2D graphics engine and P2A bridge
in this SoC.

I'm currently trying to enable VGA controller which is actually
independent from Aspeed BMC SoC. It means that the VGA can be reset
only when either host PCI bus reset or host power-on reset is asserted.
Basically, VGA hardware module is controlled by the host machine not by
the Aspeed BMC SoC.

I submitted this patch as an alternative solution of
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-clk/msg44836.html because there
could be use cases that intentionally disable the VGA controller
depend on hardware design. So it'd be helpful for reducing power
consumption and for allocating more generic memory space instead of
allocating dedicated VGA shared memory if we can flexibly config the
BCLK.

I think, we don't need to add VGA driver just for enabling the clock
because the VGA controller is actually controlled by host machine as I
explained above so I made this patch set instead.

I agree with you that we need to revisit the discussion.

Thanks,

Jae
