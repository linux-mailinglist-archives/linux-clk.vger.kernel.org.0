I've found that only marking disp_cc_pll0 as CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED fixes the
problem as well. In this case, mdp and rot clks are both actually
parented to disp_cc_pll0 at boot, but mdp is switched to XO due to
parking while rot is left on disp_cc_pll0 because only the branch is
disabled during unused clk disabling.

When I fix the parent by reading the parked_cfg value at init time,
disp_cc_pll0 is turned off pretty early because the parent of mdp is
discovered to be disp_cc_pll0. I wonder if turning off disp_cc_pll0
somehow "clears" state, but it has to be done in a controlled manner. I
also found that simply never disabling the PLL also fixes it (i.e.
returning early from alpha_pll_fabia_disable if the clk is
disp_cc_pll0). That seems to imply that something about disabling the
PLL during unused clks disabling is bad.

I've also noticed that when the RCG is enabled before turning on the
stuck off disp_cc_mdss_mdp_clk that the RCG root_off bit (bit 31) is
clear. Something is turning the RCG clk on when software thinks it is
off, but that should be OK because the parent is XO. Before this point
(and late init), the RCG is off when software thinks it is off. I
printed the config register from the unused clk disabling code and the
rcg is still off after we disable the PLL.

I also tried skipping slamming a bunch of PLL config register writes
into the PLL at probe by removing the clk_fabia_pll_configure() call but
it doesn't fix it. Maybe I need to measure the clk at probe time to see
if it is actually on XO or if it is stuck on the PLL but all the
registers are saying it is XO.
