Yes.

>=20

The paragraph at the start of "Assigned clock parents and rates" already
explains how these properties work. This patch isn't going to help if
the reader hasn't read that paragraph, so reordering things isn't
providing more clarity. If anything, I would clarify the description of
the example by indicating what parts of the example we're talking about
when explaining, i.e.

	In this example the <&pll 2> clock is set as parent of the
	<&clkcon 0> clock because the first clock specifier in the
	assigned-clocks property is <&clkcon 0> and that matches the
	first clock specifier in the assigned-clock-parents property.
	Similarly the <&pll 2> clock is assigned a frequency value of
	460800 Hz because the second frequency in the
	assigned-clock-rates property is 460800 Hz and that matches the
	second clock specifier in the assigned-clocks property <&pll 2>.
