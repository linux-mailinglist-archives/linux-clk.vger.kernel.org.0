Why not? Plenty of platforms are doing it. If anything, it's more
flexible to deal with it in the clock driver, because then you don't
have to filter out modes that aren't compatible with the frequency that
got assigned in the DT.

Also, it's more robust since that frequency isn't guaranteed to be
constant across the system life.
