Yes! Indeed that makes the clock not be stuck, and debugcc is also
correctly reporting ~24MHz from that clock when it's enabled!

  cam_cc_mclk1_clk: 23.999592MHz (23999592Hz)

Is this PLL also missing a value for .user_ctl_hi_val? The other PLLs
have that set as well.

Out of curiousity, where's this magic value from? Only some sort of HPG
doc, or is this also somewhere referenced in downstream? Curious why
this is not set there for this PLL.

This is one major step toward camss & camera support for this phone!

Regards
Luca
