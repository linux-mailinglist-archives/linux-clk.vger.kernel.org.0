Those clock may be used to supply a device in DT on another hardware 
using the same SoC.

Take e.g. this random git grep result:

arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-remarkable2.dts
/ {
   wifi_pwrseq {
     ...
     clocks = <&clks IMX7D_CLKO2_ROOT_DIV>;
     ...
   };
};

This IMX7D_CLKO2_ROOT_DIV is one such general purpose clock output. In 
the aforementioned case, it is used to supply 32 kHz clock to a WiFi 
chip, i.e. it has a consumer in DT. These clock are registered by the 
platform clock driver:

drivers/clk/imx/clk-imx7d.c

But those clock can also be used to supply e.g. CPLD which has no other 
connection to the SoC but the clock. That is where it needs this 
critical-clocks property. Because then there is no consumer in DT. So 
the kernel will now think the clock are not used and will turn them off 
after boot, thus e.g. crashing such platform.

So in the later case, the DT would contain the following to avoid the crash:
&clks {
   critical-clocks = <IMX7D_CLKO2_ROOT_DIV>;
};
