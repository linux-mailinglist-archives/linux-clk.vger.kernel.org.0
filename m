When it comes to masks and shifts in DT it's a NAK from me. I believe we
don't have a good way to understand what endianess the mask is. Is it
device order, or CPU order, or always big endian?

It's also trending toward the one node per clk style of binding that we
don't accept. I think this came up when the fixed-mmio binding was
proposed. I hoped that nobody would use it outside of FPGAs.

This needs a unit address.

Because it has a reg property. Of course, a reg property that isn't
aligned to a 4k page or so would imply that the clk is actually part of
a larger hardware block that should have a binding for the whole device
instead of picking the clk part out of the hardware and setting a node
to be exactly the one register in there that is of interest.
