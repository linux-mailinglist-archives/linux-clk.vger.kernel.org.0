Fwiw, the Apple device tree cannot be trusted in general. It also preten=
ds
that two IOMMUs that need to programmed identically are a single dive,
sometimes includes MMIO ranges that are much too large and also contains
at least a single "virtual" device that only exists for what I assume
to be a workaround for some XNU quirk(s). (the GPU IOMMU has a separate =
node
with no MMIO or anything which only attaches a small shim driver that th=
en
calls back into the main GPU driver. That device is also only used from =
within
that GPU driver.).

Are there any dependencies between these individual channels?
Is there some common initialization required for all of them?

From a quick glance and my uninformed opinion it looks like these are
separate to me. They only all need this LSFR table which could still be
shared.
