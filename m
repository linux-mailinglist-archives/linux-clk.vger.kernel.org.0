No, the RK3288 will continue to supply to the legacy projects which may 
have a long contract with Rockchip,

and RK3288W is the recommend to use in all new project.

I agree with Heiko on this.

What Rockchip done is:

- kernel is using "rockchip,rk3288w" compatible to identify rk3288w, 
which is clean in kernel;

- kernel evb dts do not have compatible "rockchip,rk3288w" for we would 
like to identify it dynamic in bootloader;

- We use U-Boot to identify the rk3288w with HDMI reg value, and pass it 
to kernel via modify the

    dtb pass to kernel, so that we can support all kind of rockchip 
customer projects with any kind of rk3288;

- For upstream kernel, it make sense to add "rockchip,rk3288w" in board 
dts for which using rk3288w SoC.


Thanks,
