By "driver" above, I mean clock driver. One example where we need this,
and currently work around it, is the Tegra124 EMC (external memory
controller) clock driver. You can find this here:

	drivers/clk/clk-emc.c

If you look at the emc_recalc_rate() function, it needs to override the
parent clock rate because CCF calls it with the clock rate of the parent
prior to the rate change, whereas the parent (and/or the rate)
potentially change during the rate change.

The reason why we can't use ->set_rate_and_parent() here is because the
consumers never actually change the parent for the EMC clock. Instead it
is up to the EMC driver to select the parent based on the specific rate
that is requested. The parent clock is encoded in a table of supported
EMC frequencies that a particular board can support. This table is
passed to the EMC driver from the firmware or hardcoded in DT, depending
on the particular SoC generation.

For a bit more background: the use-case is to accumulate a set of
bandwidth requests within the EMC driver, which can then be converted
into a clock frequency that is required for the EMC to provide that
bandwidth. Since the controls for this are sprinkled around a bit, the
nicest way to represent this is using an "emc" clock (in the clock and
reset controller) and the EMC driver that deals with programming the EMC
(which has registers separate from the clock and reset controller).

So basically how this works is that the "emc" clock driver needs to call
back into the EMC driver to perform the clock change. This being a clock
that is needed to operate system memory, we have to be very careful when
things happen. So a frequency switch typically requires the old parent
to remain enabled while the EMC is programmed with new settings and then
switched to the new parent. Only then can the old parent be disabled.
The parent change happens fairly deep inside the EMC sequence and can't
be isolated from that, unfortunately.

In order to deal with that, we basically "fixup" the clock tree after
the frequency change by calling clk_hw_reparent() manually. This in turn
causes the parent to change, but clk_set_rate() doesn't know about that.
Instead, it has the parent rate cached in a local variable, which will
no longer be the correct value after the switch has happened.

Fortunately, clk_hw_reparent() already causes the rates of the entire
subtree of clocks to be recalculated, so there isn't anything left to do
when we return from the rate change. This patch detects when this has
happened by checking that the current parent against the "cached" parent
that the cached parent rate is based on. If they aren't equal, it
assumes that the clock driver has manually reparented the clock and does
not have to do anything else.

Does that clarify things?
