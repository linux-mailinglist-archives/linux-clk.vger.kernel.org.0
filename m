Nothing stops Rockchip to change the tools to generate incremental IDs
without holes, right?

So these are IDs used by the driver, not hardware? Then they can be as
IDs as well, don't they?

Separate header under reset would still be part of the CRU DT binding -
I did not propose change that. However why storing reset IDs in a clock
subsystem binding header, instead of reset subsystem?

So these are register offsets, as I mentioned before. Bindings are not
for this, this is not the purpose of binding headers. You do not store
as binding headers GPIO numbers, IRQ numbers, block unit addresses,
right? There is only one case such offsets make sense - firmware also
uses them and you cannot change it.

This is not the case here, so these values should not be in bindings.

To clarify - I don't ask you to change the driver, you can still code
offset like that. Just don't store this as binding.

I guess no one raised the question...

These are not IDs but register offsets. You do not use them in a meaning
of ID. ID is a abstract number providing a mapping between this abstract
number and actual value. You do not have mapping here - you directly
decode this ID.
