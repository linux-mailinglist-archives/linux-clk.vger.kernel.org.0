Hi,

NVIDIA Tegra30 no longer boots with this change.

You can't assume that rate was requested by clk_set_rate() before
clk_set_rate_range() is called, see what [1] does. T30 memory rate now
drops to min on boot when clk debug range is inited innocuously and CPU
no longer can make any progress because display controller takes out
whole memory bandwidth.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/drivers/memory/tegra/tegra30-emc.c#n1437

If clk_set_rate() wasn't ever invoked and req_rate=0, then you must not
change the clk rate if it's within the new range. Please revert this
patch, thanks.
