DEAR, READ AND GET BACK TO ME


I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect , trust and humanity, honestly, I will really like to
have a good relationship with you and i have a special reason why I
decided to contact you, is due to the urgency of my situation, My name
is Miss Nancy Kipkalya Kones, 30yrs old female and I held from Kenya
in East Africa. The plane crashed on the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008.

You can read more about the crash through the below site:

http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html

After the burial of my father, my stepmother and uncle conspired and
sold my father's property to an Italian Expertrate which the shared
the money among themselves and live nothing for me. One faithful
morning, I opened my father's briefcase and found out the documents
which he have deposited huge amount of money in one bank in Burkina
Faso with my name as the next of kin. The amount is( $8. 5USD ), and I
have confirmed from the bank in Burkina Faso on my arrival, It is my
intention to compensate you with 30% of the total money for your
services and the balance shall be my capital in your establishment. I
will like to disclose much to you if you can help me to relocate to
your country because my stepmother has threatened to assonate me.

AWAITING YOUR URGENT AND POSITIVE RESPONSE,I shall appreciate an
urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this
transaction sincerely. Please do keep this only to your self for now
until the bank will transfer the fund. I have the documents for the
claims.

Yours Sincerely

Miss Nancy Kipkalya Kones
