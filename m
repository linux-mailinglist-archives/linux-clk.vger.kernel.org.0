I think there's an opportunity to save some power here by keeping the 
camss ahb disabled by default.. That would include removing the magic 
write from gcc probe, adding the gcc ahb as a proper clock and adding a 
camss consumer to it (possibly with both fw_name and name fields in 
parent_data to keep backwards compat, even though i don't think any 
board uses camera hw upstream, so we may break it here with a good 
justification). Then we could keep camcc enabled by default on all 
boards, and if there are no users, the clocks would just be parked to xo 
or disabled entirely, instead of inheriting an unknown configuration.
