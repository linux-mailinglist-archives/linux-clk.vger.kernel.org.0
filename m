I think the larger issue is around the semantics of clk_get_rate(), and
especially whether we can call it without a clk_enable(), and whether
returning 0 is fine.

The (clk.h) documentation of clk_get_rate() mentions that "This is only
valid once the clock source has been enabled", and it's fairly
ambiguous. I can see how it could be interpreted as "you need to call
clk_enable() before calling clk_get_rate()", but it can also be
interpreted as "The returned rate will only be valid once clk_enable()
is called".

I think the latter is the proper interpretation though based on what the
drivers are doing, and even the CCF itself will call recalc_rate without
making sure that the clock is enabled (in __clk_core_init() for example).

Then there is the question of whether returning 0 is fine. Again
clk_get_rate() (clk.c) documentation states that "If clk is NULL then
returns 0.". This is indeed returned in case of an error condition (in
clk_get_rate() itself, but also in clk_core_get_rate_nolock()).

All the drivers I could find either assume the rate is valid, or test
whether it's 0 or not (randomly picked, but across completely different
platforms):
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clocksource/armv7m_s=
ystick.c#L50
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/cpufreq/armada-8k-cp=
ufreq.c#L74
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/sound/soc/sti/uniperif_playe=
r.c#L194
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/sound/soc/tegra/tegra20_i2s.=
c#L278

So my understanding is that the consensus is that clk_get_rate() can be
called even if the clock hasn't been enabled, and that returning 0 is
only meant to be used for errors in general, a NULL pointer according to
the documentation.

That would mean that pcie_pll_dco is buggy because it assumes that
clk_enable() is going to be called before clk_get_rate(), gp0_pll_dco
and hifi_pll_dco because they expect "someone" to call clk_set_rate()
before clk_get_rate(), and hdmi_pll_dco because it will always return 0,
unless the display driver comes around and updates it. If it never does,
or if it's not compiled in, then you're out of luck.

If there's not a sensible default in the hardware already, I don't see
what the big issue is to be honest. You already kind of do that for all
the other PLL parameters with init_regs, and most drivers do that for
various stuff:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/imx/clk-imx6q.c#=
L917
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/nxp/clk-lpc32xx.=
c#L1550
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-rk3=
036.c#L448
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun=
8i-h3.c#L1157
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/tegra/clk-tegra2=
0.c#L1013

If the driver needs that kind of quirks in order to make the clock
usable in itself, then it just makes sense to do that, especially if
it's to avoid breaking a generic API.
