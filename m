It is not a proper fix, it is the best we can do right now. I already 
replied to Luca with a bunch of patches where I tried to come up with a 
way to negotiate the pixel clock in drivers ... I need to get back to those.

Because I have DSI-to-(e)DP bridge on the DSI bus and I do not know the 
pixel clock needed by attached panel up front.

I already included a link to DTO which allowed me to operate both this 
DSI-to-(e)DP bridge and LVDS panel with accurate pixel clock, I was 
hoping that would also let you solve 3 and 4. 4fbb73416b10 ("arm64: dts: 
imx8mp-phyboard-pollux: Set Video PLL1 frequency to 506.8 MHz") fixed 3. 
for Isaac at least.

I do fully agree the whole DT Video PLL1 clock frequency configuration 
is not good and it should not be in the DT at all. That is my goal in 
the very end.

The drivers (in this case, LCDIF1 + LCDIF2 + LDB) should negotiate the 
Video PLL1 frequency that fits them all best and configure it 
accordingly, without any DT assign-clock* workarounds.

I just didn't figure out a way to do that ^ yet.
