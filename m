Did you noticed that the error is caused for enet2_ref_sel?

On our board variants master/slave/slaveXT only ENET1 is used, so ENET2 
is kept to the defaults (ENET2_TX_CLK_DIR = 0, ENET2_CLK_SEL = 0) and 
the bootloader won't touch those bits.

After reading the reference manual, this mode refers to ENET1_TX_CLK_DIR 
= 0, ENET1_CLK_SEL = 0. Is my understanding correct?

As written above the bootloader doesn't touch this. It's the reset 
default according to the reference manual. So i consider mode 2 as 
disabled clock, which is the right mode for boards without using this 
particular Ethernet interface. For EMC reasons we don't want to enable 
ENET1 and ENET2 clock output unconditionally.

Sorry, i don't have no idea how to properly achieve this.
