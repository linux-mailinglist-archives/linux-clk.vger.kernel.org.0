The reason it exists the way it does is that the driver uses the header
files shipped and used for the device tree bindings, and they give the
same names to different constants (the first three constants are in
fact the same so don=E2=80=99t clash, but PRCI_CLK_TLCLK is different =
between
the two), so can=E2=80=99t both be in the same translation unit (at =
least not
without some gross #undef=E2=80=99ing). In FreeBSD I took the alternate
approach of just defining our own FU540_ and FU740_ namespaced copies
of the constants, as drivers do for most things anyway.
