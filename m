I believe this is implementation detail of your HW. How you do it is up
to you. User does not have any visibility to this behaviour, therefore
makes no sense to expose UAPI that is considering it. Please drop it at
least for the initial patchset version. If you really need it later on
(which I honestly doubt), you can send it as a follow-up patchset.

No, please drop it from this patchset. I have no clue why you readded
it in the first place in the last patchset version.

Sure it has to. The PIN_SET accepts pin_id and device_id attrs as input.
You need to set the state on a pin on a certain DPLL device.

Yeah, for this you need pin_id 2 and device_id. Because you are setting
state on DPLL device.


>d) SyncE daemon uses PIN_SET to set state of pin_id:13 to CONNECTED with
>   parent pin (pin-id:2)

For this you need pin_id and pin_parent_id because you set the state on
a parent pin.


Yeah, this is exactly why I initially was in favour of hiding all the
muxes and magic around it hidden from the user. Now every userspace app
working with this has to implement a logic of tracking pin and the mux
parents (possibly multiple levels) and configure everything. But it just
need a simple thing: "select this pin as a source" :/


Jakub, isn't this sort of unnecessary HW-details complexicity exposure
in UAPI you were against in the past? Am I missing something?
