Would it make sense  to add  an 'idt,enable' property in similar fashion to the existing idt,mode, idt,voltage-microvolt, and idt,slew-percent properties?  Then vc5_get_output_config() could be modified to also call vc5_clk_out_prepare() (or clk_prepare_enable(), which in turn would call vc5_clk_out_prepare()).

Having the consumer driver get, prepare and enable the clock is of
course the best as Adam explained.

However I think using assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-rates should
enable the clocks unconditionally even if the consumer driver does not
do any clk_*() calls. Might be worth double checking that.
