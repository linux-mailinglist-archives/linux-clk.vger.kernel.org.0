Well, the problem is that not all of us have access to lowlevel 
documentation, thus we have to resort to the information provided by the 
vendor kernel. Sometimes our approach to platform implementation changes.

Bindings can change (especially if the change is backwards-compatible). 
We are finishing one of such migrations (to use DT to bind parent clocks).

If you have anything particular in mind, please don't hesitate to 
describe your ideas.

Ack, externally supplied clock. That's great. Thank you.

Let's leave the question of having core_bi_pll clock to subsystem 
(Bjorn and Stephen) and bindings (Rob, Krzysztof) maintainers.
