I don't expect parents[i].core to be populated until we do the fallback
string match in this function when the globally unique names match or if
it's already populated by some other path calling
clk_core_fill_parent_index(). The problem is we just fixed a long
standing regression in this function with commit ede77858473a ("clk:
Remove global clk traversal on fetch parent index"). Calling
clk_core_fill_parent_index() will bring that performance problem back,
so we need to figure out how to find the index for a clk without doing
the global search.

It seems that some clk providers specify parents that may never exist,
so we'll possibly spend time looping through the parents each time doing
a global string comparison on hundreds of clks. It would be best to
avoid that, so we shouldn't really do any sort of caching here except
for the one clk_core pointer we already have passed in.

So you're saying this happens in the clk_set_parent() path, where the
parent passed into this function has never been cached before?
Otherwise, it looks like the only other case where it might be a problem
would be if a .round_rate() or .determine_rate() clk_op returns a parent
that hasn't been cached yet, maybe via hard-coding of the parent hw
pointer or just because they don't call clk_hw_get_parent_by_index().
I'd rather not cater to those corner cases by trying to optimize them,
so perhaps we can use this patch and avoid the regression while
supporting the use-cases we need?
