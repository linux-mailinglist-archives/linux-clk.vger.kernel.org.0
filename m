You're pointing a real issue, what should we return as a rate then ?

The rate is not only the rate output by the HW but is also used by the whole
subtree of the PLL to calculate the rates.

If we return a fake or dummy rate instead of 0 (which is the physical reality),
the clock subtree will be populated from a fake rate and if we did set a clock
rate using assigned-clock, eventually this fake rate would match and no set_rate()
would be called on the PLL.

This is why we return the true physical rate, it's the software to adapt in order
to handle the possible HW states.

It's not that we don't like it, we only care the actual HW state is correctly
reported in the clock tree, nothing else.

If a new flag like CLK_INVALID_RATE existed then we would use it.

But so far a zero rate never was problematic, and iMX8mp HDMI PLL and MSM mmpll2
also return a 0 rate as init because it's probably the default PLL state at
HW startup.
