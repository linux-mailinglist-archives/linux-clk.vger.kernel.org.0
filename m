This sounds an awful lot like the CLK_HANDOFF flag that never
materialized. We know we have a problem where the enable state of a clk
isn't understood at registration time (although we do know the frequency
of the clk). So far it's been put largely on clk providers to figure out
that their clk is enabled and avoid doing something if it is. But that's
run into problems where clk flags that want us to not do something if
the clk is enabled fail to detect this, see CLK_SET_RATE_GATE for
example. This should be fixed; patches welcome.

Within the clk framework we don't really want to care about a clk already
being enabled and keeping track of that via the enable_count. Trying to
figure out when to "hand that off" is complex, and what exactly is the
point to it? Drivers still need to call clk_enable to enable the clk, so
all that really matters is that we know the clk is on at boot and to
respect the clk flags.

Please god no more clk_get() APIs! The driver shouldn't care that the
clk is already enabled when clk_get() returns. The driver must call
clk_enable() if it wants the clk to be enabled.

Buried in here is the question of if we should allow clk_get() to
succeed if the clk is an orphan. I recall that rockchip had some problem
if we didn't allow orphans to be handed out but it's been years and I've
forgotten the details. But from a purely high-level we should definitely not
hand out orphan clks via clk_get() because the clk isn't operable
outside of clk_set_rate() or clk_set_parent().

And there's more work to do here first by getting rid of the .get_parent
clk_op and having it return a clk_hw pointer (see my two or three year
old clk_get_hw series). Once we do that we'll know if we can hand out an
orphan clk because it may one day be reparented via clk_set_parent() or
clk_set_rate() vs. the case where we shouldn't hand it out via clk_get()
because we'll never be able to parent it because the parent(s) doesn't
exist.
