Aha! That's great, thanks ChenYu!

Stephen, my thinking here is that if this feature controls the GPU 
interconnect, and only matters when the GPU is going to be used (as 
strongly implied by the downstream implementation), then the GPU driver 
is the only interested party and may as well take responsibility if 
there's no better alternative.

I'd agree that if there was already a "base" infracfg driver doing 
general system-wide set-and-forget configuration then it would equally 
well fit in there, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Short of trying 
to abuse the bp_infracfg data in the mtk-pm-domains driver (which 
doesn't seem like a particularly pleasant idea), the code to poke a bit 
into a syscon regmap is going to be pretty much the same wherever we add 
it. There's already a bit of a pattern for MTK drivers to look up and 
poke their own infracfg bits directly as needed, so between that and the 
downstream implementation for this particular bit, leaving it to 
Panfrost seems like the least surprising option.

Cheers,
Robin.
