These are good discussion points, but we're not going to discuss them in
the commit log. Try to squash these "design decisions" as succinctly as
you can.

In particular, establish that GDSCs are just pm-domains and that
"dependencies between GDSCs and other power-domains are described using
the pm-domain hierarchy".

Perhaps I'm oversimplifying it? But in my eyes these cases then becomes
different flavors of the same thing.

I'm guessing the desire to point this out comes from previous sources
where this hasn't been the case? Could you perhaps just emphasize the
fact that we should use the hierarchy to describe these relationships,
both within the controller and in the system?

Exactly what do you mean with "attach" here?

You're making each GDSC a subdomain of each of the clock-controller's
listed power-domains. While not literally being called "attached", this
is what I'm thinking of.

Is there some other way to "attach" a GDSC to these power-domains that
I'm not spotting?

> 

Or are you saying that GDSCs with an explicitly defined parent should
attach only to that GDSC and not to the listed power-domains, and that
any votes will trickle through the hierarchy up to the external
power-domains?

If this is the case, can you please rewrite this to make this more
obvious to future readers?

Rather than expressing that gdsc_enable()/disable() won't act on the
performance_state, it would be good if the commit message clarifies that
the performance_state will percolate through the pm-domain hierarchy to
those domains that handles state votes.


I think the patch looks good, and I think your commit message capture
the questions/decisions/tradeoffs we've discussed.
Please try to reformulate the message in a more succinct form. I think
you can replace the 4 "questions" with shorter statements about each
aspect of the current solution.
