Okay, makes sense. Devlink port index didn't end up well :/

Allright. So in case of ptp_ocp and mlx5, module_name and clock_id
are enough. In case of ice, DPLL_A_TYPE, attr is the one to make
distinction between the 2 dpll instances there

So for now, we can have:
 CMD_GET_ID
   -> DPLL_A_MODULE_NAME
      DPLL_A_CLOCK_ID
      DPLL_A_TYPE
   <- DPLL_A_ID


if user passes a subset which would not provide a single match, we error
out with -EINVAL and proper exack message. Makes sense?

Okay, for pin, the type and label would probably do:
 CMD_GET_PIN_ID
   -> DPLL_A_MODULE_NAME
      DPLL_A_CLOCK_ID
      DPLL_A_PIN_TYPE
      DPLL_A_PIN_LABEL
   <- DPLL_A_PIN_ID

Again, if user passes a subset which would not provide a single match,
we error out with -EINVAL and proper exack message.

If there is only one pin for example, user query of DPLL_A_MODULE_NAME
and DPLL_A_CLOCK_ID would do return a single match. No need to pass
anything else.

I think this could work with both ice and ptp_ocp, correct guys?

For mlx5, I will have 2 or more pins with same module name, clock id
and type. For these SyncE pins the label does not really make sense.
But I don't have to query, because the PIN_ID is going to be exposed for
netdev over RT netlink. Clicks.

Makes sense?

Got you and agree.

Allright, lets leave them for now. As internal kernel API, could be
changed in the future if needed.

Arkadiusz, Vadim, are you following this?
