Hi Rob,

Thanks for the review. After some internal discussions, we decide to 
choose another approach. Instead of these EMC table bindings in the DT, 
we think that would be easier to pass the binary blob of the EMC table. 
Because the timing/settings in the EMC table could be different depends 
on vendors and devices (lpddr2/3/4), unify binding may not fit for each 
vendor.

For Tegra210, lpddr4 is the only SDRAM devices we support, it's more 
complicated than lpddr2/3. And the rate above 800MHz must be trained 
before it can be used, it's done by firmware, so the table also includes 
these training data. Just want to describe the table could have many 
private settings.

So we want to go through the EMC table with binary blob, it makes the DT 
binding easier for review and control in the driver. Will re-work the 
series to support this approach.

reserved-memory {
     #address-cells = <...>;
     #size-cells = <...>;
     ranges;

     emc_table: emc-table@.... {
         compatible = ...;
         reg = <...>;
     };
};

external-memory-controller@... {
     ...
     memory-region = <&emc_table>;
};

Thanks,
Joseph
