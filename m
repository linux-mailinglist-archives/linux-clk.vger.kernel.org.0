I think the module would need to be merged with netdevsim or some such.
The usual process is for module to be part of the normal kernel build
and then require appropriate CONFIG_* options to be set.

I wonder about Python availability. If anyone who works on embedded
knows of Linux platforms which don't have Python - please shout.
Hopefully we're good on that side.

PyPI is a bigger concern, I think pure SW tests are often run in VMs
without external connectivity.

Does it work on a read-only file system? People may mount the kernel
sources over read-only 9p or nfs.

I think the time constraints are more of a question of practicality.
A developer should be able to run the tests as part of their workflow.
