I think we should hope to get lucky or play whack-a-mole and merge
something like this series. If we have to we can similarly turn off RCGs
or branches during driver probe that are using shared parents like we
have on sc7180.

Put simply, the shared RCG implementation is broken because it reports
the wrong parent for clk_ops::get_parent() and doesn't clear the force
enable bit. With the current code we're switching the parent to XO when
the clk is enabled the first time. That's an obvious bug that we should
fix regardless of implementing proper clk handoff. We haven't
implemented handoff in over a decade. Blocking this bug fix on
implementing handoff isn't practical. Furthermore, we're relying on clk
consumers to clear that force enable bit by enabling the clk once. That
doesn't make any sense, although we could use that force enable bit to
consider the RCG as enabled for clk_disable_unused.

An alternative approach to this series would be to force all shared RCGs
to be parented to XO at clk registration time, and continue to clear
that RCG force enable bit. That's sort of what Dmitry was going for
earlier. Doing this would break anything that's relying on the clks
staying enabled at some frequency through boot, but that isn't supported
anyway because clk handoff isn't implemented. It avoids the problem that
the first patch is for too because XO doesn't turn off causing a clk to
get stuck on. I can certainly craft this patch up if folks think that's
better.

To ease the transition we can make a new clk_ops for the RCG as well so
that each SoC has to opt-in to use this behavior. Then we can be certain
that other platforms aren't affected without being tested first. I'd
prefer to not do that though because I fear we'll be leaving drivers in
the broken state for some time.
