Both, in a way. Some boards (about 1 in 20 or so) would hang after a few 
days of operation.

During our investigation, we found they would never hang under stress 
testing, so we started examining cpufreq-related factors.

Disabling lower OPPs also prevented hanging. If we artificially lowered 
the OPP voltages (undervolting the chip), the boards would hang much 
faster without the patch, and even the previously stable ones would 
start to hang.

Unfortunately, no, not really. We only use the T507 and A40i at the moment.
We’ve never had these kinds of issues with the A40i, though. By the way, 
the A40i is among the few Allwinner chips with reparenting implemented 
in the mainline.

The A523/T527 is really nice; it's a pity it's limited to 4GB RAM.
