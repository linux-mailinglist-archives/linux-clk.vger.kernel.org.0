Afaict we still have the problem that if the interconnect driver is
compiled as a module, or for other reasons doesn't probe until after
late_initcall() clk-smd-rpm will turn off these clocks and we never will
get a chance to probe the interconnect provider.

I believe the way to handle that is to rely on sync_state, but there
seems to be a lot of corner cases here.

But with that in place, I agree that we should handle this temporarily
during bringup by the use of clk_ignore_unused.

I always thought is_enabled() should reflect the hardware state - in
particular for clk_summary. The particular concern being that by
initializing the is_enabled() state to either true or false, we're
making an assumption about the hardware state. And if something where to
do if (enabled) disable (or if (disabled) enable), we might skip a
critical operation just because we tricked the logic.

So, do you need it for anything other than clk_disable_unused()?

I have a clock in the MDP with similar issue, where we don't have
is_enabled() but I need it to be disabled by clk_disable_unused(),
because the next iteration turns off the parent and locks up the still
"active" rcg.
So far I've not received any feedback on this though...
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210707043859.195870-1-bjorn.andersson@linaro.org/

With this approach we don't make any assumptions about the hardware
state, beyond the fact that we will issue a disable in
clk_disable_unused() if no one has yet enabled the clock - which at
worst turns off a clock that's already is off.
