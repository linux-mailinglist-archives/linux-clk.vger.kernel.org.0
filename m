I just got an update from Renesas support, which confirms our table as
far as possible:

> I find that SH will only work when the Polarity bit is set to Active Low (SP=0).  When I program SP=1 together with SH=1, the outputs are always off. It simply won’t work.  So the Shutdown function can only be used with Active Low polarity for the SD/OE pin.  There is a pull-down resistor on the chip so when the pin is left open, outputs will be enabled with Active Low polarity.

It is only partly useful because it turns off more circuits than the Output Enable function but there is still significant power consumption in Shutdown. The general expectation of a Shutdown function is that the power consumption will go down to a few microamperes of leakage current when in Shutdown but this device will not do that.

The combination SH=1 and SP=1 is not well specified, so I can't confirm
whether it should be Inactive/Shutdown or Shutdown/Shutdown or whatever.
Also I would not define the SH=1 and SP=1 combination as "illegal" but
rather as "useless".

Definitely (and obviously) the outputs are never driven when SH=1 and
SP=1. So I think we can stick to your table and I think this patch is
fine, more details are not needed in the DT bindings IMO. The only open
point now is the remark by Geert about the 'if: true' construct.
