I can see what you are doing, but I don't think this is the right
thing to do.  Please put the struct in the same location as it's
referenced.

And yes that should also be the case for prci_clk_fu740 and yes, it
was over-looked because it wasn't causing warnings at build time for
whatever reason.

IMHO, placing 'struct of_device_id' match tables in headers is also
odd and is likely the real cause of this strange situation.
