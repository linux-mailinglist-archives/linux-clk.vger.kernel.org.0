Note: I'm talking about the clk-smd-rpm (+ SMD RPM interconnect)
drivers here (not RPMh), but I guess the same applies for that as well.

That makes sense to me since it would also prevent these clocks from
getting "disabled" when unused.

I'm not sure, most of the RPM drivers are basically pretty much just
long struct definitions for the available regulators, clks,
interconnects, ... of one SoC. Combining this all into one driver would
likely become rather "messy"...

Hmm, I'm not sure how to implement this in a backwards compatible way.
In particular, clk-smd-rpm supports SoCs that:

  - Have no interconnect driver at all (MSM8998, SDM660, ...)
  - Had the interconnect device nodes added much later than rpmcc
    (MSM8916, MSM8974, ...)
  - Have some clocks that are not covered by the interconnect drivers yet,
    e.g. RPM_SMD_GFX3D_CLK_SRC (Is this even interconnect? Not sure...)

In all those cases they likely (implicitly) rely on rpmcc to keep all
clocks at maximum rate, even if unused. If we were to move the
interconnect clock management to the interconnect drivers, we would
still need to handle the clocks somewhere in all those cases.

How would this work?

Thanks,
Stephan
