Do you see a particular need to add a specific clock? Can't we just rely
on clk_ignore_unused as a global indicator for this as well?

There's a case here that we don't handle today; say you have two clocks
A and B, which are both parented by the same RCG. Some driver enables
clock A for a while and then disables it, at this point there's nothing
indicating that some piece of hardware (with a not yet probed driver) is
using clock B and that it must not be turned off until said driver has
had a chance to "park" the hardware or cast its vote.

This is a good goal. But I don't think we should do this solely by
cutting the clocks as the clock driver probes. I do think we need to
allow the various drivers to turn off the hardware nicely before cutting
any remaining clocks.

Right, this is a stretch goal for now.

I am somewhat surprised that we haven't yet seen problems as we try out
the approach of just cutting clocks without first shutting down the
client driver. It might work for display, but I would not be surprised
if cutting clocks like this will cause problem for the clocks that feed
some external entity and then comes back in (e.g. PHY clocks).

Also not that while this might work for dispcc, we should ensure to park
all clocks that are flagged enable_safe_config downstream before we turn
off their parents. In SM8350 GCC there are 44 of these, several of them
you won't be able to just turn off - e.g. there's the UART.

The idea that Qualcomm (and Google) builds on for this is to rely on
sync_state in the clock drivers and essentially 1) ensure that clocks
aren't turned off until that point 2) clean up unused clocks when all
known clients have probed.

The problem with sync_state is that clocks resolved by their global name
is not known beforehand, so sync_state will fire prematurely.

That's fine for clocks where you can test that, but we have several
clocks where you can't read the state.

One such set of clocks are clk-smd-rpm, which we can't query and we may
not turn off until all the client driver have probed - as they provide
e.g. clocking for the busses.

This problem is not limited to the display driver, so adding a new
clk_get() won't scale.

So how do you handle the case when the display driver probe defers?
I think you're trying to reinvent the sync_state callback.

I agree, but it seems that we need to be more correct in order to
support the newer platforms (SM8350/8450 etc)...
