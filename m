Not really. Since the two composite clock control the same mux bit, 
consider what would happen if you were to select pll4_p_ck as parent for 
one (e.g. ETHCK_K), and pll3_q_ck as parent for the other (e.g. 
ETHPTP_K), what would be the result ? I guess the result would depend on 
when the reparenting of each ETHCK_K/ETHPTP_K happens on boot, and I 
don't think that's how it should work. With a single mux controlling 
that one single bit, such situation wouldn't happen.

> Adding "ck_ker_eth" would impose a new clock to take in DT ?
Nope, the ck_ker_eth is without ID and internal to the driver. They 
exist only to describe the clock tree correctly.
