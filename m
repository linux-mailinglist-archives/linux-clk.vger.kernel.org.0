What does that mean?
Perhaps if you clearly explained what the problem is and what you want
us to change instead of making cryptic statements like "this is not a
binding" we wouldn't have to waste all this time exchanging emails that
aren't getting anywhere.

You didn't explain earlier. You typed some words earlier, but they
failed to explain, and you are continuing to fail to explain.
