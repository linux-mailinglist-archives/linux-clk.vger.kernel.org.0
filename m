I see a problem. __clk_recalc_rates() uses 'core->rate' as "old rate"
but we'll have already destroyed that by calling
clk_core_update_orphan_child_rates() and assigning 'core->rate' to the
recalc_rate. Are clk notifiers being used? If so, it will probably be
confused because the notifier will see the same rate as what was set
instead of the old rate. cpufreq is probably the biggest user of clk
notifiers.

We should add a test for that so when a clk is reparented the old rate
is still what we expected it to be when the notifier is called.

Also, clk_core_update_orphan_child_rates() is poorly named. It doesn't
care at all that the clk is an orphan. It seems like another
__clk_recalc_rates() without the notifier. I have no idea why we need
another recalc rates. Possibly setting the req_rate in
__clk_recalc_rates() is sufficient. Or maybe we should bail out if the
clk doesn't have the orphan bit set.
