Thanks. Pulled into clk-next. I guess we should increase the size of the
number of parents that can exist to be more than a u8? We're close to
getting there with the new way of specifying clk parents, so maybe we
should expand it to an unsigned int, but then we may need to optimize
finding parents when searching through all the parents of a clk.

Also, there isn't any quantification of how much better it is to scan DT
for all the clks that are used and only register those ones. It would be
nice to understand how much better it is to do that sort of scan vs.
just populating all clks at boot time. It may be useful to make the code
generic because NXP folks also want to populate clks from DT so maybe we
should provide this from the core framework somehow to ask providers to
register a particular clk or not. I haven't thought about it at all, but
it may come up that we totally rewrite this code in the future to be
shared outside of the TI clk driver.

FYI: I had to apply this patch on top to make sparse happy.
