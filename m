Is there a way to change these values from user space app code?  If not, would it be ok to add code to my consumer driver (say in the probe method) that would read the values from the json and then call set_rate() and prepare_enable()) ?

This is absolutely not a standard practice in the kernel. If drivers are
well written then a consumer driver knows which clock it needs, it will
ask the produced that frequency and configure the consumer device
accordingly.

E.g. if the consumer device is an audio codec then user space will never
say "I want you to ask for a 1 MHz clock" but rather "I want to playback
at 48 kHz", then the driver will ask for a given clock frequency and
configure the codec to use it, perhaps setting divisor/multiplier
registers etc.

So I really suggest you to understand what the correct kernel-userspace
interface would be for your consumer driver. If you want you can share
what the consumer device is so we can be give some suggestions.

That said, if you don't want to mainline your consumer driver nobody
will prevent you from doing anything "strange". But keep it limited to
your driver, you don't want to have conflicts in the versaclock code
when you upgrade to a more recent kernel.

Also, I don't think json is expected to be in the kernel. If you want to
do something like that then maybe parse json at userspace level and then
send just the frequency in Hz via a sysfs entry.
