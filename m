I was hoping for the Arm SoC tree, because there are some dependencies
(MMP3 USB PHY depends on MMP3 SoC).

That said, the irqchip patches are rather independent and the only
downside of them going in via a different tree will be that the other
tree that will lack them won't boot on MMP3 (things will compile
though). I don't know if that's okay. What's typically done in cases
like these?
