I'm not totally opposed to this but I'm curious if you have a plan to
fix various drivers that are violating the documentation? I'm more
inclined to leave the documentation as is, which indicates that it isn't
promised to work but sometimes does work. Given that we've supported it
for quite some time I don't see the downside to keeping supporting it
vs. the many downsides of implementing a check like this and having to
fix various places that now WARN_ON() (and if you have many on some
particular device then you'll have to work through them one by one?)

What problem are you trying to address? Is there some issue you've
encountered in the kernel that would have been fixed by having this
warning? If so, please point to it in the commit text! Then we can all
see the value of this patch. Right now I don't see much value.
