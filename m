Yes that works too. It's really up to robh here.

Cool. Using assigned clock parents is good.

If they're in the binding then they should make sense instead of just
being random values. So please move the defaults to the driver and
have human understandable DT properties to tune these settings. This has
been done for the qcom USB phy already (see things like
qcom,hstx-trim-value for example).

No I mean there should be a triple dot at the end.
