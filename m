Not for the rk3308. If you're looking for live-examples of handoff clocks,
I can provide another examples though:


rockchip/clk-rk3288.c - pclk_rkpwm (in the separate critical clock list) ... with
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3288.dtsi - clock is supplying pwm nodes.

As the comment in the clock driver suggests (line 850), some boards use
pwm-regulators for central components. The pwm-regulators are configured
at boot already, so the clock shouldn't be disabled till the pwm-regulator takes
over.


The whole memory handling is a blank slate on the kernel side for Rockchip
boards still. The bootloader sets up the memory and nobody has found the
time to modell things like memory scaling in a nice way yet.
