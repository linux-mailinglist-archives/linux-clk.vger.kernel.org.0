Probably this needs to be combined with the previous patch.

I think the next sentence is part of the single sentence paragraph
above.

The parent of the parent can't be the parent of the child, i.e. itself.
I guess this is only a problem if clk_core_init_rate_req() starts
setting min/max? We want to leave those members unchanged so that the
rate request can flow up through the tree and be modified when rounding
rates from a grandchild. That's why the child req is passed up to the
parent if the child can't round itself. The boundary of the child is
moved to the parent.

Definitely the rate should be clamped through a parent to the
grandparent taking into account any of their constraints. Perhaps the
bug is that __clk_determine_rate() doesn't clamp to boundaries like
clk_hw_round_rate() does by calling clk_core_get_boundaries() and then
mixing in the new requests boundaries.
