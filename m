The issue with this is that we are getting close to tying bindings with
your Linux implementation. What if other implementation does not use
these names as prefix and instead creates some other clock names (as
clock names are not considered ABI)? Your binding would still enforce
such property with a specific pattern.

The clock names should not really matter, so if you have conflict of
names among multiple controllers, I think driver should embed unit
address in the name (as fallback of clock-output-name) and the binding
should not enforce specific pattern.

I can easily imagine a real hardware board design with
"sexy_duck_ccc_pll1_out3" clock names. :)

Best regards,
Krzysztof
