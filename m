I was thinking about a test that can be run against real HW.
Something that a new vendor implementing DPLL can run and
validate that their implementation behaves as expected.
And something that distributors and stable kernels could
potentially use to validate the code still works.

We don't have any well established user space to make use of this 
new functionality, there's high risk that drivers will invent their
own ways of interpreting the API.

Perhaps something that Red Hat could help with? I'm guessing you'd 
be writing test to validate this for RHEL, anyway?
