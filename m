G'day Stephen,

Thanks for looking at this.

For our system the regulator needs to be enabled before we try talking to the chip.
Funny that.
Unloading the driver will disable the regulator thru the devm call to
cdce925_regulator_disable

In the future suspend/resume support could be added to power the device down.
The system I have doesn't support suspending thou.

No I didn't update that.
It seems a bit adhoc if supply reference are including in the DT docs.
I can add something if your happy with the pathc in general.
