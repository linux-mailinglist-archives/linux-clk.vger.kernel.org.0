That's not what I said, and it's also not something that enable is
allowed to do anyway.

Consider this: the clock feeding a hardware component is out of its
operating range. You enable it. The device gets stuck. How do you
recover from that?

Resets the rate to what?

The first thing clk_set_rate is doing is a clk_get_rate. If you want to
actually enforce a rule that hasn't been applied for 15y, go ahead, but
that means also mandating that you can only make clk_set_rate calls once
the clock has been enabled.

I mean, I kind of agree, but also, the clock framework is newer and has
been more liberal than the clock API. And the clock framework is by far
the dominant implementation now, so I'm not sure what the big deal is.
