This patch series is a preparation for the MX8 Architecture improvement.
As for IMX SCU based platforms like MX8QM and MX8QXP, they are comprised
of a couple of SS(Subsystems) while most of them within the same SS
can be shared. e.g. Clocks, Devices and etc.

However, current clock binding is using SW IDs for device tree to use
which can cause troubles in writing the common <soc>-ss-xx.dtsi file for
different SoCs.

This patch series aims to introduce a new binding which is more close to
hardware and platform independent and can makes us write a more general
drivers for different SCU based SoCs.

Another important thing is that on MX8, each Clock resource is associated
with a power domain. So we have to attach that clock device to the power
domain in order to make it work properly. Further more, the clock state
will be lost when its power domain is completely off during suspend/resume,
so we also introduce the clock state save&restore mechanism.

It's based on latest shanw/for-next branch.

The top commit is:
3c1a41dab7b8 Merge branch 'imx/defconfig' into for-next

ChangeLog:
v6->v7:
 * addressed all comments from Stephen
 * rebased to latest shawn/for-next
v5->v6:
 * add scu clk unregister if add provider failed
v4->v5:
 * Address all comments from Stephen
v3->v4:
 * use clk-indices for LPCG to fetch each clks offset from dt
v2->v3:
 * change scu clk into two cells binding
 * add clk pm patches to ease the understand of the changes
v1->v2:
 * SCU clock changed to one cell clock binding inspired by arm,scpi.txt
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/arm,scpi.txt
 * Add required power domain property
 * Dropped PATCH 3&4 first, will send the updated version accordingly
   after the binding is finally determined,
