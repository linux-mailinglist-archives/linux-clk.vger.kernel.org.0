Hello Michale, Stephen,

I would like to ask you to review the 2nd patch of the series
  [PATCH v7 0/6] serial: mvebu-uart: Support for higher baudrates

The series can be found at
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/20210930095838.28145-1-pali@kernel.org/

the second patch at
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/20210930095838.28145-3-pali@kernel.org/

We need to implement this clock driver inside the UART driver, because
the clock configuration registers unfortunately are in UART driver
space and various cross mutexes between clock driver and UART driver
would have been needed otherwise.

Could you please review this and give your Reviewed-by / Acked-by, if
there aren't any problems? We would like to move on with it since we
sent it 40 days ago and didn't get the necessary reviews yet.

Thanks.

Marek
