I don't think there is any problem with the 'safe' configuration you
mention. I have not tried, but we should be able to use that. However,
my understanding is that reparenting does not fail because the clock
itself is in an "unusable" state, but because the new parent is in an
"unusable" state. We can run the clock from XO, but that wouldn't solve
the problem of reparenting to the PHY (until the PHY is fully
configured).

(It would help a lot if you can find someone from the hardware team at
 Qualcomm to confirm that. Everything I write is just based on
 experiments I have done.)

So, assume that DISP_CC_MDSS_DPTX0_LINK_CLK_SRC is already running from
XO, but the PHY is powered off. Now of_clk_set_defaults() gets called
and we get the call to clk_set_parent() while the PHY is off. How do we
deal with that? Returning 0 without actually changing the parent would
result in inconsistent state, as I described above. clk_get_parent()
would return the new parent, but actually it's still running from XO.

With my changes in this series the clock state is always consistent with
the state returned by the clk APIs. We just delay the call to
clk_set_parent() until we know that it can succeed.

Thanks,
Stephan
