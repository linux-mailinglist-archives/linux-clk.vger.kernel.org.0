(was: "clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: add never-disable option")

Hi!

The purpose of this series is to allow a WDT that has been enabled by the
bootloader to survive these events:

- deferred probing of the WDT device, which can lead the clock driver
  to disable the WDT clock until the WDT is re-probed, giving it a
  blind spot
- probe failure in the WDT driver

Following a suggestion by Geert, this revision, instead of adding another
list of clocks with special handling, changes the semantics of the
crit_mod_clks[] array slightly by only marking clocks critical that are
enabled at boot time. That way it can be used for RWDT without forcing the
clock on unnecessarily.

The other existing user of crit_mod_clks[] (INTC-AP) is always on at boot time
and should thus not be affected by this change.

There are a number of Gen2 and RZ/G1 SoCs that have the RWDT clock declared
as critical already in order to allow SMP bringup code to work. That should
still work with this series applied, assuming that the WDT clock is on at
boot time.

Changes since v3:
- drop separate array, add RWDT to crit_mod_clks[]
- only mark clocks as critical if they are enabled on boot

Changes since v2:
- use the term "never-disable" instead of "ignore-unused"
- do the handling internally instead of relying on the behavior of
  CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED

Changes since v1:
- rename data structures for clarity
- squash SoC-specific patches into one per family
