Yeah, it is a matter of implementation. I just thought that this is
possible to be done in a single attribute, because when the pin is
disconnected, the direction has no meaning.

Sure, I didn't put the PRIORITY attribute to the example, but I believe
it is very straightforward extension to add it.

Does the mux have any attribute/configuration valuable for the user.
If yes, it might make sense to have it as a separate object. Then we
can have it as a tree of object of type MUX with leaves of PIN.

The question really is, if the user needs to know about muxes and work
with them, or they can be abstracted out by the driver.

Could you elaborate a bit more why auto-select mode and priorities are
problematic with muxes in picture?
