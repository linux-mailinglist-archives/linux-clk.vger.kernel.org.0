I didn't see any difference on time to console activation with this
enabled.

I don't disagree on "the right thing to do" although I am a little
surprised to see the old hack removed a replacement is ready. IIUC
the modularization for GKI doesn't require them to be changed.

To be honest I have relaxed a few expectations in my test harness and
have already moved on ;-).

Right now the console will not come up until after we have decompressed
the ramdisk even when we have configure the kernel to have a rich set of
console drivers built in. That does feel pretty uncomfortable as a user,
especially if you have a large initrd but the test suite doesn't mind!
