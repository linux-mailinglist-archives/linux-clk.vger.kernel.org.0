So not a state but a flag.

1. The clock tree we declare _should_ be a fair and complete description
    of the hardware clock tree.

2. If we remove XO from some trees with the only indication of
    differentiation being the callback you bind the tree to you need
    someone reading the code both know about parking, derive that
    information from reading the callback, which means you require that
    person to read the code in detail and understand it.

    That's alot of tribal knowledge we are storing up there.

3. A different approach is to add a new CLK_DISABLE_PARKS_TO_XO - or
    whatever name makes sense.

    a) The clock tree declared in the gcc, camcc, dispcc, videocc or
       is correct and aligned with the documentation and silicon.
       Right away this avoids patches sent to 'fixup' incomplete trees.

    b) When you look at a clock struct clk_branch_gcc.clk.hw.init.flags
       there is a big dirty CLK_DOES_THIS_THING flag which doesn't
       require a developer to have tribal knowledge about how we've
       hacked up clock parking.

My basic point here is the declaration of a parked clock should be 
obvious, easy to understand and not lend itself to "helpful" patches to 
"fix" the clock tree.

Also consider precedent. When you want to quickly get your clock 
controller up and running - you generally open existing upstream stuff 
to clone and own as much as possible. A BIT_DIRTY_FLAG transmits more 
information than a small callback with esoteric logic buried inside of 
the disable path.

I agree with your point on a new state but similarly I think the 
callback buries too much information away. IMO the top level clock 
declaration - rather like the DT should as closely as possible declare 
an accurate clock tree.

If we need to do special stuff to an individual tree, then CLK_FLAG it. 
Are qcom clocks really the only clocks in the world that need to park to 
XO on the disable path ?

Alternatively continue on with the callback but make the name more 
instructive not "park" since we are dealing with people who have English 
as a second language, third language. English is my first language but 
still a "parked" clock means little to me except that like you and 
Dmitry I work with qcom stuff so I understand it.

"disable_park_xo->clk_disable" or something - even still I think 
removing XO from the clock tree is asking for trouble.

Start from the principle that gcc/camcc/dispcc clock trees should be 
complete and work from there.

That's my 0.02 anyway.
