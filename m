Yes and no. We already have clocks not present in the tree for different 
reasons: being handled by the RPM(h), being critical to the platform 
integrity, being useless for Linux, etc.

I think adding a huge comment should help. Because otherwise you sound 
like 'we should not expect kernel developers to read the code', which is 
not true.

But the problem is that this flag is not generic at all. I think we will 
be damned and prosecuted if we try adding anything about PARK_TO_XO to 
<linux/clk-provider.h>.

And also there is always a question on the state integrity: if the clock 
is parented with the XO on the driver bootstrap, should CCF treat it as 
'parked' or as 'enabled, clocked by XO'?

We already tried doing that... And it failed. For the PHY PIPE clocks we 
ended up doing exactly the same thing, because it simplified the code 
_a_lot_.

clk_rcg2_disable_parks_to_tcxo_ops ? Slightly ugly but I'm fine with that.
