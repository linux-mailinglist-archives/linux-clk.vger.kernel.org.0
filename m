Right.

I suppose if/when that happens we can have a small parent driver that
probes the compatible string and makes two child platform devices, one
for the clk part and one for the PMU? That would let us keep the code in
drivers/clk/ for ease of find-ability. This assumes that the PMU
registers don't overlap with the clk/reset registers. We usually put the
clk and reset controllers together if they use the same registers and
need to make sure the frameworks don't stomp on each other.

Ok. I'm not too strong on it either, but drivers/soc/ is sort of a
dumping ground for random soc things. I'm not looking at it closely but
if the driver is in drivers/clk/ I'd be more inclined to look after the
clk bits.
