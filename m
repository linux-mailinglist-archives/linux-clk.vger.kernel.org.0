That's a very good point... Which raises another one. Would it be ok to
notify users on a reparenting? It would make sense to me, since the rate
could be affected, but it's not been done so far so I'm not sure what
the implications might be

I can do it, but I'm not sure what you want to test exactly. Let's
assume we have a mux with a given rate, we change the parent of that
mux, the rate is likely to be changed as well and we should put in the
notifier that the old_rate is the first parent's, and the new rate the
one of the new parent?

You're right, the only difference between the two (aside from the
notifiers) is that req_rate is also updated in
clk_core_update_orphan_child_rates().

Either way makes sense to me, the latter is probably less intrusive, but
the former allows to consolidate __clk_recalc_rates() and
clk_core_update_orphan_child_rates(). Which one would you prefer?
