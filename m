The skew controls delay of the clk signal for the given output. So
basically it is phase, but enumerated in fractions of the internal
oscillator.

Audio analyzer (DAC, ADC, clock, protection, ranging, etc.). Fine-tuning
the frequency can be used e.g. for sampling an analog oscillator with
slowly drifting frequency. Clock skew is required for adjusting delays
introduced by the various HW components so that all synchronous clock
signals reaching the DAC/ADC correct delays against each other. It will
take some experimentation and hard-coding the values in the device tree
config is not practical.

The alsa controls in snd-aloop are directly used by that module. In my
case the alsa driver would have to know how to operate specific features
of the specific clk driver, yet serving just as a proxy for the
controls. The alsa driver itself needs only the standard clk API for its
operation. IMO controlling the specific clock features directly is
correct as the features are provided by the specific clock HW and do not
interact with the standard clock API.

Nevertheless, in the end I decided to control all the Si5340 features
via I2C from my userspace application (incl. clk frequency settings),
avoiding the existing kernel Si5340 driver alltogether.

Thanks a lot,

Pavel.
