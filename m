I disagree. Martin's suggestion is correct for the fsel part which is
symetric.

Apparently, you are relying on the SYS PLL lowest possible rate to
enfore this contraint, which I suppose is 24 * 32 =3D 768MHz. It would be
nice to clearly say so.

That does not sound very solid ...

... Because PLL needs to relock, it is going to be off for a while. That
is not "broken", unless there is something else ?

In which case ? I'm lost.

... How are you going to do that without relocking the PLL ?

There is an example of syspll notifier in the g12 clock controller.
You should have a look at it
