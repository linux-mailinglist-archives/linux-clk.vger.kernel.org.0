It's OK if the patch is unchanged or has only changes that are
minimal/irrelevant.

DT should describe hardware, not implementation. The difference is
subtle at times, but it is important. Other OSes, bootloaders,
firmwares, whatever can have a totally different implementation but use
the same DT.

Well, the first goal of my rephrasing was to change from "If no
properties are specified, then they will be left in their default state"
(telling what _your_ _Linux_ implementation _does_) to "if you don't
tell how your HW is done, the implementation is not in a position to do
the right thing" (telling what DT must _describe_ to _any_
implementation for it to work properly). I hope this clarifies the idea.
Again, it's a subtle but very important difference.

While rephrasing I also thought I would be more explicit than "if
(unspecified) {can't do the right thig}" and go direct: "you should
specify either of them". I would like to say "must" in place of "should"
but we must take care of existing DTs.

Perhaps these properties might be made mandatory later, after upgrading
all DTs (at least those in mainline Linux). and a grace period.

This used to be my understanding too. However I recently got this from
Renesas support and got confused again: "SH=1 means that you want the
ShutDown function.  ShutDown fixes the polarity to active low so the SP
bit becomes don’t care.".

However looking at table 5 in the 5P49V6901 datasheet and other docs it
seems you are right, and SP is don't care if SH=1 AND SD/OE pin is low.

Forget my comment, this latest definition from you seems very good, but
please keep also the "This corresponds to..." sentences, they remove any
potential bad misunderstanding.
