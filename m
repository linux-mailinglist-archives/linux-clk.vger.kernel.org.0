Apologies perhaps I am misunderstanding how this new system
works. In the event of the parent clocks being specified in
DT, whilst going round this loop would you expect the clock to
match on the core == parent check?  Or on the fallback unique
name check? My assumption was on the core == parent check, and
if that is the case how would you expect the parents[i].core
field to have been populated?

Thanks,
Charles
