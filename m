Why would enabling a clock change it's rate unless the current rate wasn't
actually valid? I can only see a change explicitly occurring if the clock p=
arent
has decided that the associated rate was not acceptable.

If some device always resets the rate when enabled, isn't that already
problematic?

Well, if enabling a clock doesn't change it's rate there's nothing stopping
people from enabling the clock prior to getting the rate.

Thanks for taking the time to talk with me about this. I assume there is so=
me
specific thing that violates my understanding of how this should work, but =
I
feel like things are too loosely defined as is.
