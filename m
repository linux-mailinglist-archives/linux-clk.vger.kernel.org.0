It looks like we have a kind of split-brain situation, and my thoughts 
are following:
Even though right now we don't have any hardware supporting 
freerun/standalone mode, I do really like the idea to have it. It will 
be used in monitoring implementations where we refer to internal 
oscillator (Rb/Cs) as a source of truth to compare with the signal on 
the other pins. We can name it DETACHED if it sounds better.
