I guess this means that if a company not having a long contract
wants to keep producing an RK3288-based product, it will have to
resort to RK3288W.

And IIRC, it's meant to be a direct replacement.

So you proposing to move this revision detection code
from the kernel to all the bootloaders (U-Boot is not the
only one, right?).

I understand that bootloaders are maybe less strict
to quirks like this, but OTOH this approach seems like
just movint things around, plus requiring now to update
two components, instead of just one.

And also, are we sure the bootloaders maintainers
will accept the quirk?

Thanks,
Ezequiel
