To be fair, yours is one of the reviews we're waiting for!

See [PATCH 03/11].

Which in general is the correct thing to do.  Having a large threaded
series on the list containing in the form of subsequent
versions gets real confusing real quick:

| [PATCH v2 01/05]
| > [PATCH v3 01/05]
| [PATCH v2 02/05]
| > [PATCH v3 02/05]
| -> [PATCH v4 02/05]
| [PATCH v2 03/05]
| [PATCH v2 04/05]
| > [PATCH v3 04/05]
| [PATCH v2 05/05]
| > [PATCH v3 05/05]
| -> [PATCH v4 05/05]
| --> [PATCH v5 05/05]
| ---> [PATCH v6 05/05]

However, you should wait for a suitable period per submission, to give
each maintainer a chance to review the patches they are responsible
for.

If dropping recipients is your tactic of choice (I wouldn't choose to
do that myself), just ensure you keep everyone on Cc for the
cover-letter ("[PATCH 00/00]") and maybe indicate the fact that they
have been dropped and why ("dropped Lee since the MFD patches have
been reviewed and are unchanged in this series").  Reason being;
if/when a set is applied, the cover-letter is used as the Reply-to
for sending out the pull-request to all those concerned.
