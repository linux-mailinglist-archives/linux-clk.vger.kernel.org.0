Have you got some reference to this debate ?

I think something like clk-hog , similar to gpio-hog , would be useful, 
since we could also configure the critical clock frequency in DT.

This is the case I had here, yes. Although I've been running into 
similar requirements repeatedly for almost a decade, I'm surprised 
nobody implemented something like this yet.

This is an iMX53 board from 2012 or so, where they figured they don't 
need an XTal for the CPLD because the SoC has this OSC_OUT and that can 
be used to supply clock to the CPLD at just the frequency they need. So 
the SoC is a clock source for the CPLD, and that's all there is to it.

So far I hacked it in the clock driver to keep the clock running at 
specific rate, but that hack has been a thorn in my side for long enough.

This does not seem to describe what is needed here, protected-clock are 
used to tell OS not to touch certain clock because they are protected by 
e.g. firmware access restriction, it does not say anything about whether 
the clock are critical. Also, it seems to be a non-generic property only 
for some qualcomm clock driver.

commit 48d7f160b10711f014bf07b574c73452646c9fdd
[...]
dt-bindings: clk: Introduce 'protected-clocks' property

Add a generic clk property for clks which are not intended to be used by
the OS due to security restrictions put in place by firmware. For
example, on some Qualcomm firmwares reading or writing certain clk
registers causes the entire system to reboot, but on other firmwares
reading and writing those same registers is required to make devices
like QSPI work. Rather than adding one-off properties each time a new
set of clks appears to be protected, let's add a generic clk property to
describe any set of clks that shouldn't be touched by the OS. This way
we never need to register the clks or use them in certain firmware
configurations.
