Hei hei,

I'm currently reworking this series.  Everything else is more or less
clear to me, but this core clock array index stuff makes knots in my
head, see below.  (I keep all the context, because it's been a while …)

This is not true, at least not anymore.  I try to wrap it up.

We have 13 different drivers now for 15 different compatibles/SoC
variants:

at91rm9200.c
at91sam9g45.c
at91sam9n12.c
at91sam9rl.c
at91sam9x5.c
at91sam9260.c   -> also for 9261 and 9263
sam9x7.c
sam9x60.c
sama5d2.c
sama5d3.c
sama5d4.c
sama7d65.c
sama7g5.c

Those use different sets of core clocks allocated by
pmc_data_allocate() and with different maximum index aka array size.
No driver uses all members of pmc_data->chws, each leaves more or less
many holes, each hole around 44 bytes AFAICT.

(I have a spreadsheet for this now if anyone is interested.)

I need to add a new clock (main rc oscillator) for using the OTPC, a
block available on sam9x60, sam9x7, sama7g5 and sama7d65.  The max
indexes for those are:

sam9x60:    PMC_PLLACK = 7                      (using 4, wasting 4)
sam9x7:     PMC_LVDSPLL = PMC_MAIN + 12 = 15    (using 8, wasting 8)
sama7d65:   PMC_INDEX_MAX = 25                  (using 12, wasting 13, defined in source!)
sama7g5:    PMC_MCK1 = PMC_MAIN + 10 = 13       (using 8, wasting 6)

Note: sam9x7 uses `PMC_AUDIOPMCPLL (PMC_MAIN + 6)` and above _and_
PMC_PLLACK which is after or lets say in between the "PMC_MAIN +
branchoff thing", making things even more messy.

I could just add PMC_MAIN_RC = PMC_MAIN + 15 = 18 now, this would be
more or less okay for the newer SoCs I guess, but it would mean 19
array members for sam9x60 of which only five are used, so 14 * 44 byte
wasted.

Over 600 byte wasted for a solution which already is quite messy?!

If there are no objections, I'm going to make this binding splitup now.
I see 2 variants:

1. full splitup per SoC/driver?
2. opportunistic approach keeping the old stuff up to sam9x60 and
sama5, and just create new headers for sam9x7 and shared
sama7g5/sama7d65?

Question is about naming the symbols then.  I guess it would be a bad
idea to define the same thing twice with different values like this?
Have this in one file for sam9x60:

    #define PMC_MAIN_RC 10

and this in a different file for sama7:

    #define PMC_MAIN_RC (PMC_MAIN + 15)


So I rather introduce some new headers including different new
per SoC values like this?  For sam9x60:

    #define SAM9X60_PMC_MAIN_RC 10

For sam9x7:

    #define SAM9X7_PMC_MAIN_RC (PMC_MAIN + 13)

For sama7*:

    #define SAMA7_PMC_MAIN_RC (PMC_MAIN + 15)


And then keep all the old names for now?  Should some definitions be
moved to the new headers already?  Add some comments maybe?  Or
duplicate the old definitions like this?
Keep in generic header:

    #define PMC_MCK3 (PMC_MAIN + 13)

Add in separate header:

    /* same as PMC_MCK3 */
    #define SAMA7_PMC_MCK3 16

I'll come up with something and you can review the patch series then.
Just let me know what you think, I mean Microchip, it's your SoCs and
drivers, I just need the UID on sam9x60, I did not intend to climb
down this rabbit hole in the first place. ;-)
