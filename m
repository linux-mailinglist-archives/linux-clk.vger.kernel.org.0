No, I also suggested this only from the conceptual perspective. It would
be interesting to test this, but unfortunately I don't have a suitable
device for testing this anymore.

It probably does, but isn't that exactly what you want? If the parent
(or the GDSC itself) would actually *power off* (as in "pull the plug"),
then you would still lose registers even if the GDSC remains on. The
fact that PWRSTS_RET_ON works without keeping the parent on is probably
just because the hardware keeps the parent domain always-on?

I might be missing something obvious, but mapping this to the existing
pmdomain API feels pretty straightforward to me:

 - Power on/power off means "pull the plug", i.e. if you vote for a
   pmdomain to power off you should expect that registers get lost.
   That's exactly what will typically happen if the hardware actually
   removes power completely from the power domain.

 - If you want to preserve registers (retention), you need to tell the
   hardware to keep the pmdomain powered on at a minimum voltage
   (= performance state). In fact, the PCIe GDSC already inherits
   support for RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_RETENTION from its parent domain.
   (If RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_RETENTION happens to be higher than the
    rentention state we are talking about here you could also just vote
    for 0 performance state...)

With this, the only additional feature you need from the pmdomain API is
to disable its sometimes inconvenient feature to automatically disable
all pmdomains during system suspend (independent of the votes made by
drivers). I believe this exists already in different forms. Back when
I needed something like this for cpufreq on MSM8909, Ulf suggested using
device_set_awake_path(), see commit d6048a19a710 ("cpufreq: qcom-nvmem:
Preserve PM domain votes in system suspend"). I'm not entirely up to
date what is the best way currently to do this, but letting a driver
preserve its votes across system suspend feels like a common enough
requirement that should be supported by the pmdomain API.

I don't doubt that. My point is that the PCIe driver should make that
decision and not the (semi-)generic power domain driver that does not
exactly know who (or if anyone) is going to consume its power domain.
Especially because this decision is encoded in SoC-specific data and we
had plenty of patches already changing PWRSTS_OFF_ON to PWRSTS_RET_ON
due to suspend issues initially unnoticed on some SoCs (or vice-versa to
save power).
