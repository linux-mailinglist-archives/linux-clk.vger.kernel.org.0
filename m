So you interpret it as: "The value returned by clk_get_rate() for a
disabled clk might differ from the actual rate the clk has once it is
enabled.", right?

I agree with Stephen that the semantic isn't as clear as it might be, so
this should be improved.

I wonder what should be the consequence here. Is it still true that
clk_get_rate() should not be called for a disabled clk? Or for an
unprepared clk?

Best regards
