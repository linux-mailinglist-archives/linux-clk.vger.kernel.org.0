I am sorry I probably misunderstood your previous reply then. I am fine
with the assigned-clocks workaround.

Indeed, thanks to your feedback we got it fixed locally, so short term
is okay for us (but people not reading this thread might still suffer
from the problem though).

Ok, good to know we are aligned :-)

Of course, getting rid of the DT workarounds is probably a long term
goal, unlike the mid-term goal which is: "fixing" today's situation for
"everyone with a simple setup". We are also looking into this and
willing to find a proper solution.
