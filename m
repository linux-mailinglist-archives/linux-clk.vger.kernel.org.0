Thanks.

I think the name "sd" is misleading.

In the Renesas docs (which are very confusing on their own about this
topic) this bit is called "SP" -- *S*D/OE *P*olarity. But actually it
controls polarity of the SD/OE pin only if the pin is configured for
"OE" function:

(VC6E register and programming guide [0])

As such I suggest you use either "sp" to keep the naming used in the
Renesas docs or "oe" as it actually controls OE polarity only. I do
prefer "sp" as it helps matching with the datasheets, but maybe adding a
little more detail in bindings docs to clarify, as in:

 idt,sp-active-high:
   $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
   description: SD/OE pin polarity is active-high
                (only works when SD/OE pin is configured as OE)

BTW is it only me finding the "Shutdown Function" of [0] completely
confusing? Also, Table 24 has contradictory lines and missing lines. I'm
sending a request to Renesas support to ask them to clarify it all.
