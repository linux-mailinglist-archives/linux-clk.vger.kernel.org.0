Yes, this is doable.

The steps I did were
1. generate coverage.info file per steps above
2. git diff HEAD~ > /tmp/inc.diff
3. <my personal script> --info=coverage.info --diff=/tmp/inc.diff

We'd just change step #2 to be `git diff HEAD~3..HEAD > /tmp/inc.diff`

As mentioned upthread, unfortunately my personal script in step #3
isn't open source or open sourceable atm.
I wrote it using some internal company code for parsing LCOV .info
files out of expediency, but there's nothing too complicated about it.
Just need to find what lines were "added" and intersect that w/ the
coverage data.
