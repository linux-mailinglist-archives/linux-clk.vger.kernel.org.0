In general, it's best for a driver not to rely on any preprogramming
done by e.g. the bootloader before.

The concept of "One-Time Programming (OTP) bits" adds yet another
dimension to the already complicated boot chain of dependencies.
But due to the one-time feature I consider that more stable than
other firmware, which can be upgraded, causing changed behavior,
unlike OTP bits.

Yes, they should be marked as required.
But the driver can keep on not touching the bits if none of
the new properties is specified.

BTW, I didn't check the datasheet, but is there a way to read the OTP
bits from software?  If yes, the driver could use these values if the
new properties are not present.  That would make the system more
robust, as it would reset the values (if ever changed) to a sane
state in case of a soft reboot.
