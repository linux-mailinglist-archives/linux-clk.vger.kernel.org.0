I guess I got hung up on that bultin DT thing, but I've sort of decided I don't
really care that much (though I guess I didn't decide enough to reply to the
email...).  I don't think it's 5.11 material: we were told to be stricter this
time around because of the timing, and I'm trying to sort out a boot issue
that's manifesting post 5.10+for-next merge so I probably won't have time to
take more stuff.

Also: I'm kind of trying to avoid the whole thing where I take patches that
have a bunch of versions sent either right before or during the merge window,
as it just makes things too hard to keep track of.
