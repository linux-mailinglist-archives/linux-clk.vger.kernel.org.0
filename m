No, I'm not an expert in this clk driver so I have no idea if this is
some sort of supply that is typically always on or if software is
expected to manage the regulator at runtime. I'm just asking to make
sure that your use case requires this be managed at runtime instead of
turned on immediately when the regulator driver probes and left on
forever.

Sounds like it's all fine then. Just document it in the binding and it
should be fine to add.
