Ok, but the other failure modes are going to happen outside of
developing the driver? What failure of ioremap() are you trying to
catch?

And even if knowing which resource didn't map properly, wouldn't we be
better off moving the error message closer to the actual problem in
ioremap() so it can tell us the problem that was seen? Otherwise I fear
the driver is going to tell the user that some error happened but we
won't be able to really figure out what the error is.
