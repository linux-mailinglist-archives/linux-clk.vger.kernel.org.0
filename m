During development one can introduce a dispcc parameter. Maybe we should 
add qcom-common parameter telling dispcc drivers to skip parking these 
clocks.

I think we have several separate tasks here:

1) Support developing code. This is what you have in mind with EFIFB + 
clk_ignore_unused.

2) Get display to work stable and rock solid. This can include 
completely tearing down the display pipeline for the sake of getting 
MDP/MDSS/DSI to work with as few hacks as possible.

3) Gracious handover of display/framebuffer from bootloader to the Linux 
kernel.

For the task #1, you can hack the dispcc as you wish or set any 
additional parameters, as you are already passing clk_ignore_unused. 
This will all end up as #1 transitions to #2.

I was targetting task#2. Disable everything to let dpu/dsi/dp start from 
the scratch. If I understand correctly, this approach would also help 
you with your boot-clock-too-high-for-the-minimum-opp issue. Is my 
assumption correct?

For the task #3 we need collaboration between dispcc, clock core and 
dpu/dsi drivers. Just marking the clocks for the clk_disable_unused() is 
the least of the problems that we have here. I think [1] is a bit closer 
to what I'd expect.

I have a similar but slightly different idea of how this can be made to 
work. I'd do the following (excuse me for the hand waving, no code at hand):

- Add clk_ops->inherit_state callback, which can check if the clock is 
enabled already or not. If it is, set the enable_count to 1, set special 
CLOCK_INHERITED flag, read back the state, etc.

- Make of_clk_set_defaults() ignore clocks with CLOCK_INHERITED flag. 
Maybe it should return special status telling that some of the clocks 
were not updated.

- Add clk_get_inherit() call, which would drop the CLOCK_INHERITED flag 
and return previous flag state to calling driver. The driver now assumes 
ownership of this clock with the enable_count of 1. This way the driver 
can adjust itself to the current clock state (e.g. drop the frequency, 
disable the clock and then call of_clk_set_defaults() again to 
reparent/reclock clocks as necessary, etc). If the parent chain is not 
fully available, clk_get_inherit must return an error for INHERITED 
clocks, so that the driver will not cause reparenting of the orphaned 
clocks.

- If the driver decides for some reason to abandon the device for some 
reason (because of the probe() failure or because of the remove() 
callback being called) it will disable all clocks as expected, 
effectively parking them (but not marking them as inherited). This way 
next driver probe() attempt will start from the scratch, without 
inherited state.

But as this is a complex solution and will take several iterations, I 
suggest teaching dispcc to park clocks at boot.
