Ok, good. It's a bit frustrating that people can even seem to agree on
answers to direct questions about that.

Sounds like you've done your research.

Just quoting Bjorn.

Sure, but that was only part of what those commits did or claimed. Bjorn
also explicitly stated that those refclocks were sourced from CXO, even
though I now see a claim from Shazad in that thread claiming the
opposite:

	https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y2Imnf1+v5j5CH9r@hovoldconsulting.com/

Without access to docs I can only ask questions and try to do tedious
inferences from incomplete open sources (e.g. downstream devicetrees).
