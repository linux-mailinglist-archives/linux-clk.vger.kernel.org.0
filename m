So the kernel is at least able to ask for the max frequency during
rounding and figure out that the frequency can't be larger than that. Is
that right?

Got it.

Alright. I feel like we've discussed this before.

It really looks to me like we're trying to hide the firmware API behind
the clk API. When the clk API doesn't provide what's needed, we add an
API to expose internal clk details that the clk consumer should already
know because it sets them. That's my main concern here. The driver is
querying an OPP table through the clk framework.

Why can't we either expose the firmware API directly to this driver or
have the firmware driver probe and populate/trim an OPP table for this
display device so that it can query the OPP table at probe time to
determine the maximum frequency supported. The clk framework isn't in
the business of exposing OPP tables, that's what the OPP framework is
for.
