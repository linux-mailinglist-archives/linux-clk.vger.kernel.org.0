I'm a fan of _get/_put semantics for these types of critical sections.
In hindsight I wish that the all of the rate change APIs followed a
_set/_release or _get/_put pattern. clk_rate_exclusive{_get,_put}
probably gets the idea right, but only for a limited use case.

In your case, it would be cool to set the min rate at driver probe,
then _set the rate to perform work and then later _release the rate
once work was finished, and the default behavior in that case could be
to try and target the lowest possible rate.

Seeing as how the common clk framework just celebrated its ninth
birthday a few days ago on March 16, maybe it's time for a rewrite
with almost a decade of lessons learned? ;-)

Anyways, I digress. For a real solution to your actual problem, could
your driver do something like:

  clk_set_min_rate(clk, min_rate);
  clk_set_rate(clk, operating_rate);
  do_work();
  clk_set_rate(clk, min_rate);

The final rate at the end of this sequence may end up being min_rate,
or could be something higher based on the constraints of a different
struct clk in another device driver, which is taken into consideration
during clk_core_get_boundaries() which gets called in the clk_set_rate
-> clk_calc_new_rates path.

New flags and boost APIs both make me a little sad :-(

Best regards,
Mike
