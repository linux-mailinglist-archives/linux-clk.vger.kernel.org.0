Oh, sorry, it's a common source file, rather than a header.

Okay, so I went and actually looked at the code this time.

If I were you I would move all of the device specific structs and
tables into the device specific header files, then delete the device
specific source (C) files entirely.

There seems to be no good reason for carrying a common source file as
well as a source file AND header file for each supported device.
IMHO, that's over-complicating things for no apparent gain.
