I don't see any mention of of_clk_detect_critical() here. We don't want
to enshrine the critical clk flag in DT. There was a bunch of discussion
about this on the mailing list years ago and the end result was this
instantly deprecated function to set the flag based on a DT property.
That thread isn't mentioned here either.

I see that there isn't any more 'clock-critical' in the kernel's dts so
I wonder if we would be able to get rid of that function or at least
hollow it out and see if anyone complains. Either way, what is the
actual problem trying to be solved? If the crystal oscillator isn't used
anywhere in the kernel why are we registering it with the clk framework?
