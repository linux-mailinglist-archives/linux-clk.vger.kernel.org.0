The thing is that disp_cc_mdss_mdp_clk_src has been parked to XO by the
time late_init runs. The branch clk (disp_cc_mdss_mdp_clk) has been
enabled and disabled repeatedly during boot as well, and all those times
nothing has signaled a failure. That means the RCG has supposedly
switched away from the disp_cc_pll0 to XO (parked) and the branch isn't
stuck on or off. So how does turning the mdss_gdsc or mmcx off during
late_init cause the branch to get stuck off if the parent of the RCG is
XO? Is something changing the parent back to the display PLL?
