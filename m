Got it. Why, in the latter case, would we register the clk with the clk
framework? I can see that they're "critical" in the sense that there's
no consumer node in DT and we want to make sure that nothing turns it
off. But it's also wasteful to even register the clk with the kernel
because no device is using it. It feels like we need a property like
'clock-dont-register' which is very simiilar to 'protected-clocks'.
There's already a binding for 'protected-clocks' so maybe that should be
reused and the definition of what the property means can be flexible to
handle the various use cases. The cases would be first this one here
where a clock doesn't matter because nobody uses it and second how it is
used on qualcomm SoCs where they have blocked access to certain clk
registers in the firmware so that the system crashes if we try to
read/write those clk registers.

The dt-binding can be reworded as "the OS shouldn't use these clks" and
then the implementation can skip registering those clks with the
framework.
