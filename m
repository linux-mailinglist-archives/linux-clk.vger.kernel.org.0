Unlike the other mix drivers, this is a pure clock driver, not a power 
domain driver. The PD is already available to this clock driver, see:
[PATCH v3 5/6] arm64: dts: imx8mp: Add SAI, SDMA, AudioMIX

Can you please elaborate on the deadlock problem ?
Because really, I just don't see it.

Were you able to reproduce the deadlock with this driver ?

Which part of the lengthy thread do you refer to ? I suspect the 
'permalink' might help pointing to specific email in the thread.

Note that the aforementioned thread discusses the other mix drivers 
which are PDs, this driver is not, there is a difference.
