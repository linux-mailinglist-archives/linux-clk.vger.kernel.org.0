I wish I could dig this out from the commit
f110711a6053 ("irqdomain: Convert irqdomain-%3Eof_node to fwnode")
but it kept silent what the motivation of doing that.

For me the fwnode API brings an agnostic interface which is good thing to have
and makes it easier to be used by other providers (you know that we have swnode
besides ACPI and DT, right?).

I would like to re-use clk-gpio in ACPI based environment and I found it quite
difficult without changing a lot of things in clk framework which is tighten to
OF by nails. This is not good from design perspective and makes my journey
miserable. Of course if clk is against this, I would live with copy'n'paste
approach â€” no hard feelings. Just let me know.
