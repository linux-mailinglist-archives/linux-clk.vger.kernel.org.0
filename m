Hello

 

Good day

 

I am Ivone Siciliani from ENOKEE group of companies based in Rome 
Italy

 

We will love to make an inquiry about a product we saw on your 
website earlier last week.

 

We showed them to some of our clients and they loved it and said 
we should get more information about the product.

 

Please give me a quote of the item i choosed in the form i filled 
on your website.

 

If you have a company catalogue i will love to go through it 
too,maybe we could see other products we will love.

 

Which date and time can you be avaliable for a phone 
conversation?maybe we could discuss better about the project.

 

Waiting for your quick response.

 

 

Best Regards

Ivone Siciliani
