Hi Mike=20

Happy birthday I guess ? :)=20

Like I said, it wouldn't really work in our case unfortunately

We have several occurrences of that in the SoC, but the one I'm the most
familiar with is that we have two HDMI controllers that have an internal
state machine, and both are fed from the same clock.

This state machine needs a clock that is at least as fast as the pixel
rate (plus some margin), but there's no real upper boundary, it just
needs to be fast enough to move pixels around (as opposed to a "real"
pixel clock or an audio clock that is fairly rate sensitive).

The thing starts to get a bit messy when both HDMI controllers would run
at different resolution, since in this case, you would have one
controller that would call clk_set_rate to enforce its state machine
rate, and then the other.

This would work fine is the second controller runs with the same or a
higher resolution, but if the second controller runs at a lower
frequency you just stalled the first one by dropping the rate below
what its state machine requires.

clk_set_min_rate feels like it's aimed at what we want to do: we set a
minimal frequency for each user, and the clock runs at the maximum of
all the minimums.

Our sole issue with it is really that whenever that maximum of minimums
drops to some lower value (because the display is disabled for example,
or changed to a lower resolution) the actual rate of the clock isn't
changed, consuming more than we would expect from that workload.

This makes sense to some extent if we consider clk_set_min_rate and
clk_set_max_rate functions only as functions to modify the boundaries,
since we are still totally within the operating boundaries of the clock.

But then we're missing something to negociate the best rate for a given
clock between all its users.

I guess another way to implement something like that could be a callback
to return the ideal state of a clock for a given clock + users, that
would be ran each time a clock parameter (rate or boundary at least)
would change?
