Hey,
After the clock driver for the PolarFire SoC was accepted I started work
on the onboard RTC & found out that the reference clock for the rtc was
actually missing from the clock driver.

While restructuring the clock driver to add support for the rtc
reference, I noticed that there were some problems with how the FIC
clocks were being used. The FIC clocks are the cpu side inputs to the
AXI fabric interconnections & are not the clocks for any peripherals.

This series fixes the problems I noticed:
- the fic clocks incorrectly had the AHB clock as their parents
- the last fic, named differently to the others, had not been set as
  a critical clock
- some peripherals on the fabric side were incorrectly using the cpu
  side fic clocks, resulting in incorrect rates.

I added fixes tags to these patches in the hope that they will make it
into 5.18. I kept series separate from [0] as that fixes something that
is broken, while these are only wrong.

Thanks,
Conor.
