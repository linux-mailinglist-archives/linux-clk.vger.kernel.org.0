Ok. I see that this is how the meson clk driver does clk_regmap structs.
I agree that if the same data exists for many clks then having a pointer
to that data instead of duplicating it is good for saving space, but
that sort of detail can still be put into a void *data member of the
wrapper structure(s) and then passed to some function that knows the
type of the data that's the same. It may require writing a few more
functions to unwrap the data member out of the wrapper struct though so
having a data member of the clk_hw or clk_core pointer may be useful to
make "polymorphic" code that just knows that the data member is some
particular type and can operate on that generically without having to
unwrap the container for each different type.

TL;DR is I'm half convinced that this is a good approach to solving that
sort of problem.
