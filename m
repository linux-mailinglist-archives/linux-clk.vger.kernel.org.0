After some investigation, I believe that those display-related should be
set to CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED. It's not that it breaks some drivers if not
enabled, but it breaks hardware functionality and the device won't boot.
See, for example, clk-bcm2835 in which all PLL and PLL dividers clocks
are marked with CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED and some with CLK_IS_CRITICAL.

Maybe Dave has some input about the topic?

So far, I'm planing to keep CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED to the display-related
clocks and remove CLK_IS_CRITICAL from RPI_FIRMWARE_PIXEL_BVB_CLK_ID. If
you have any objections about it, let me know.
