I suggest to stop telling folks that they must enable the clk before
getting the rate. The documentation says

 "This is only valid once the clock source has been enabled"

which is really ambiguous. What is "this?" supposed to be? Is it trying
to say the clk isn't toggling at the frequency until it is enabled, so
the rate isn't valid until it is toggling? Or is it saying that the
return value isn't valid until the clk is enabled?  It's been there for
a long time, in fact since Russell introduced the header file on arm in
2004[1]. I'm inclined to read it as:

 "The clk won't be toggling at the rate returned by this function until
  the clk is enabled by clk_enable()"

Maybe send a documentation update instead?
