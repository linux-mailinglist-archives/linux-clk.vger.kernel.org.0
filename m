I don't know anything about 8998, so it's possible.
My statement was based on a quick look at the downstream code:

For some reason there is an entirely separate MSM clock framework
downstream:

 1. During msm_clock_register() [1] it calls __handoff_clk()
    for all the clocks.

 2. __handoff_clk() [2] calls clk->ops->handoff(clk) and if that returns
    success (HANDOFF_ENABLED_CLK) it adds the clock to a "handoff_list".
    -> rpm_clk_handoff() [3] forces the clock on similar to mainline.

 3. In a late init call (clock_late_init()) [4] it iterates over
    "handoff_list" and reduces the prepare_count again and eventually
    disables the clock.

In this patch I implement something equivalent to (3).

I guess I was lucky then :)
