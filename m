Hi Mike, Stephen,

please find below a pull-request converting a number of Rockchip
clock controllers to yaml, which shound go on top of the previous
pull request.

In the discussion Stephen had comments about the optional clocks, that
have a circular dependency (xin24m -> cru -> i2c -> rtc -> xin32k -> cru) .
After everyone put in their argument, the discussion itself just stopped.

I've picked up the conversion patches anyway, as this is the status-quo
in terms of modelling clocks on Rockchip, so the yaml conversion doesn't
change anything in either direction and just transforms what is in the
kernel right now into the yaml format which will improve devicetree checks
a lot and also reduce the number of warnings emitted by the checker.

So hopefully please pull :-)
Thanks
Heiko
