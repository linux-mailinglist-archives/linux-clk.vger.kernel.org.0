Hello Uwe,

thanks for your effort on improving this. See below.

With your change the assigned-clock-parent is a clock also listed with the=
=20
clocks a few lines above, don't know if that's less puzzling?

Let me repeat for the audience here (I initially asked on #armlinux IRC=20
channel), what I did not understand, maybe someone else has an idea how to=
=20
better explain it.

=46irst: I'm experimenting on a SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK board and want to use one =
of=20
the PCKx to output on some easy accessible pin (to see the signal on a scop=
e).=20
On our real hardware that clock will be input for another IC on the board=20
connected to the EBI external memory interface. I wrote a dummy driver to=20
prepare/enable that clock, nothing sophisticated. The dts nodes working now=
=20
are these:

The chain (desired) is like this: crystal -> mainck -> prog1 -> pck1 -> fpg=
ack

You can choose slck, mainck, pllack, upllck, mck, or audiopllck (names from=
=20
sama5d2 series datasheet) as source clock for each channel of the programma=
ble=20
clock controller. That controller is modelled as prog0, prog1, prog2 and pc=
k0,=20
pck1, pck2 in dts.

Now the three puzzling things from the clock-bindings docs:

There are in fact three lists, assigned-clocks contains clocks you want to=
=20
assign parent or rate, those don't need to be the clocks your node uses, bu=
t=20
may be any clock higher up in the chain which affects your node. Right? Tha=
t=20
in itself is puzzling.=20

Beyond that: could I have added those properties to the nodes pck1 or prog1=
 as=20
well and which one would be the right node to choose?

The last hard to understand part from the example code (not the describing=
=20
text) is the linkage between those three lists. Each entry in assigned-cloc=
k-
parents and assigned-clock-rates must correspond to the same index list mem=
ber=20
of assigned-clocks, but you can omit entries in the back. Suggestion to=20
improve the example:

 Configuring a clock's parent and rate through the device node that consumes
 the clock can be done only for clocks that have a single user. Specifying
