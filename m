Yes. It has no rate. I won't change until something make it so

Well, I disagree :/

It does report its rate, it does not have any.

Agreed, it depends on what you expect from clk_get_rate().
Still when something does not oscillate, the rate is 0.

If a driver call clk_get_rate() on an uninitialized, unlocked PLL, I
think returning 0 makes sense.

If you don't need it, no.
