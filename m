This would be much better.  You don't need to explain every detail
of the code, but providing the motivation this way and explaining
it at a high level helps the reader a lot.

I just had a talk with Guodong and he helped clear up a
misunderstanding I had about this.  I was thinking about
what happens at probe time, and that only the K1 or the
K3 CCU will get registered.

But he explained that the issue is that two *drivers* claim
to support the same "compatible" auxiliary device name, and
even if only the K1 CCU got registered, both reset drivers
are available in the kernel and you still need to specify
which reset driver you want use.

You are implementing both the K1 and K3 reset code in the
same module, which I think is why this is necessary.

No I no longer have concerns and I accept that you need to
encode the platform/SoC in the reset auxiliary device name.

What I'd prefer is to just name the resets directly, to encode the
platform ("k1" or "k3") where defined.  I.e.,

  static const struct spacemit_ccu_data k1_ccu_mpmu_data = {
-	.reset_name	= "mpmu-reset",
+	.reset_name	= "k1-mpmu-reset",
  	.hws		= k1_ccu_mpmu_hws,
  	.num		= ARRAY_SIZE(k1_ccu_mpmu_hws),
  };

Does this lead to a problem somewhere else?  What does hiding
this convention behind the _K_RST() macro do that's better
than this?  Is it because you want the separate clock and
reset drivers to use the same convention?

I think it's a little more difficult to talk about this because
we're talking about changes that are implemented by two separate
patch series.

First, I suggest you avoid even using such a macro.  But I
could be wrong about that too...

I would name it RESET_NAME(_unit) or something similar.  It's
only used by code and DTS files that are related to SpacemiT
platforms.
