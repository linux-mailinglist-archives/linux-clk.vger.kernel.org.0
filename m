The only trouble with that argument is that it falls apart under the
slightest scrutiny ;)

The relevant parts of the power domain, IOMMU and GPU drivers are every
bit as SoC-specific as the clock driver, and it is the generic syscon
driver which owns and manages the actual MMIO space.

All in all this has now convinced me that it *is* worth the slight extra
effort to put random infracfg stuff in the random infracfg stuff place.
And by "slight" I mean it turns out I've spent longer writing this prose
than bashing out the illustrative diff below, which is the last opinion
I shall have on this matter. Feel free to take it and fix it, or do 
anything else if you prefer :)

Cheers,
Robin.
