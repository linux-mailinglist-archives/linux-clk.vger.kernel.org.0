I don't think that's the right way to look at it. Making the VPLL driver
multiply the requested 200MHz rate by 8 assumes that it knows that the
next block in the clock tree is a divider capable of dividing by 8.
That's not something the VPLL driver should know about. The next block
may be able to divide by 10 and up only, which means that the VPLL
should then be configured to output 2000 MHz.

The problem that needs to be solved is to find a global optimal
configuration for cascaded PLLs and dividers.
