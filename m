Awesome, thanks for following up.

Does anything go wrong if we just leave these clks enabled forever out
of boot? I'm inclined to rip the clks out and just slam the branch
enable bit on all the time in gcc driver probe and return NULL to the
callers of clk_get() for these clks. I don't see how this would be a
problem because when the upstream phy is disabled this clk is disabled
and so we aren't wasting power. It should also save us time and memory
because now we don't have to call into the clk framework to turn it on
and sequence that just right in the phy driver.
