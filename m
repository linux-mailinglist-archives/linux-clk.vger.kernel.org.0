Ok, let do not generalise this discussion too much :-)

I bringed above as example that some times device tree could not
be changed and it is provided by board supplier, not by Linux OS
supplier.

In this particular case vendor device tree blob is using standard=20
clock bindings. Just upstream Linux clock driver don=E2=80=99t have =
support
for some of the clocks. This is what these patches fix.
