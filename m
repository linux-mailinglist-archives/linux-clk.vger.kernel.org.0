We should pick a rounding policy that we want for the test. The test
shouldn't be checking the rounding policy. It should be checking that
the code under test does what is expected when the rounding policy is
what we choose.

If __clk_mux_determine_rate() returns an error when the rate is lower
than the parent supports then we should test that as well and make sure
it does return an error in this case. We can directly call
__clk_mux_determine_rate() after registering the clks so that the
function is isolated.

We should also be testing what the clk API will do if a determine_rate()
clk_op returns an error. And what it will do if the clk has multiple
parents, etc. I'm mostly confused that it's marked as a FIXME when the
test should be doing wacky things to test various pieces of code.
