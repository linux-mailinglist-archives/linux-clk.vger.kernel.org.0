I have no problem determining the prepare/enable state at clk
registration time and then using that to make the clk flags work
properly and to skip calling down into the prepare and enable clk_ops.
It needs to be disjoint from the counts though so that the possibility
of handing off the count is removed.

No? Why can't the caller of clk_get() call clk_enable()?

Yes

Who is turning off the clk? Some driver or the disable unused code?
