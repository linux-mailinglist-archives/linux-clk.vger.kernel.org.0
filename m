Ok. Is it a regulator that is expected to just always be on though? Or
does the datasheet for this device indicate that these supplies can be
turned on and off when the device isn't in use?

Yes, the binding needs an update to list out the supplies. If they're
not always going to be enabled because they're controlled supplies in
the design then it makes sense to me to add them to the binding and use
them from this driver so that things operate properly.
