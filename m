At clk framework level, a user must always call clk_prepare then
clk_enable. Usually clk_prepare is used to do action that can take
time like locking a pll and clk_prepare do the short and atomic action
like gating the clk.

Then, clk_prepare can be a nop if a clk is only doing clk gating as an
example. The same can happen for clk_enable when a pll can't be gated
as an example

What I wanted to say when we discussed offline is that scmi can
provide some PLL and some simple IP clock gating. The PLL would want
to be enabled during the clk_prepare because it's take time and you
can even sleep whereas IP clock gating want to be atomic
So scmi clock 0 might be a PLL with clk_prepare == scmi_clock_enable
and clk_enable == nop
but scmi clock 1 could the clock gating of a HW ip and want
clk_prepare == nop and clk_enable == scmi_clock_atomic_enable

Yes that would be the right behaviour IMHO

Another thing to keep in mind is the use of clk_prepare and clk_enable

clk_prepare/unprepare is usually called when you open/close a driver
whereas clk_enable/disable is called close to the use of the HW ip for
power consumption consideration. If you only use clk_prepare, the IP
will be clocked much more than needed. But if you alwayse use
clk_enable with atomic transfer, you end up taking lot of time to
enable your IP because the parent PLL will be locked at that time in
addition to miss some timing requirement
