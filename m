Hmm.. So basically it's a way to configure the clk to have no parent
anymore and not be orphaned but output a clk signal? I'll have to think
about this more but maybe this means we should let clks parent to
themselves to indicate that they're not using anything else to output a
clk signal, i.e. clk_set_parent(clk, clk) would make it a root clk if
it's possible.

>=20

A follow-up patch is fine for this. I'll stack it on top and merge it up
to clk-next.
