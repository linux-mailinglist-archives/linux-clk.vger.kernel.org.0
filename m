How do we expect distros to use the same driver on different hardware
with unchanged BIOS? It seems like anyone who wants to use this driver
now has to know what is wrong with their BIOS and build their kernel
with the config set or not? Looks like a headache. We shouldn't be
changing the kernel build configuration for something that we detect at
runtime.
