I'm not sure why you insist so much on the "true physical rate" tbh.
That was never really a thing. It's not for a gate, it's not for a
spread-spectrum clock (which would be even more interesting to report
properly following your criteria). And then you have the clock
accuracies that are throwing it off entirely too.

It just isn't practical, and that's why no-one relies on it.

Or let's turn it the other way around. When you'll have called
clk_enable() on those clocks (but only that), what do you expect the
rate to be? 0? Yet, the "true physical rate" probably changed by then.

If that was a thing, we would also have to:

  * make sure clk_set_rate can't be called on a disabled clock, because
    the true physical rate would never match what is required

  * rate ranges just wouldn't be usable either, because we would have no
    way to check that the true physical rate is actually within that
    range at any given time.

  * All clocks rate wouldn't be cacheable to account for the jitter in
    the system clock source.

  * We would need to use some hardware engine that reads the clock rate
    being output at any given time, to account for spread-spectrum and
    the clock source accuracy.

  * We wouldn't be able to report phases properly, because you can't
    really measure the clock skew either.

I understand that it's convenient for you, but it isn't practical if we
look at it from the framework's PoV.

You could very well initialize the PLLs to have a 1/1 ratio to their
parent, that would probably be sensible and would make the framework
happy.

And two wrongs never made a right.
