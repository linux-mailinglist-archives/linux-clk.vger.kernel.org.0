Ouch, that's unfortunate!  If your patch landed, I wouldn't have had to
spend such a long time to figure out why my platform fails to reach vlow
power mode :(

I do not really understand why smd-rpm clock driver needs to be a special
case.  This is a very common issue, mostly in device early support phase
where not all clock consumer drivers are ready.  Flag CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED
and kernel cmdline 'clk_ignore_unused' are created just for that.  Those
"broken" platforms should be booted with 'clk_ignore_unused' until they
have related consumer drivers in place.  IMHO, properly reporting enable
state to framework is definitely the right thing to do, and should have
been done from day one.
