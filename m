Hi Kathiravan,

Afaict, this patch introduces support that doesn't have a user today,
and as such should be merged together with:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20230217083308.12017-4-quic_kathirav@quicinc.com/

Which hasn't yet been picked up...

But please send such patches together in the future, to make it easier
for people to review and me to merge them.


I will resume picking up patches for v6.4 after the merge window.

Regards,
Bjorn
