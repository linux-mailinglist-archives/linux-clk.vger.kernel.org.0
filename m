Hi Maxime, as always, thanks for the series!
Some extra context, and comments below.

To complete this:

RPi4's firmware implements DVFS. Clock frequency and SoC voltage are
correlated, if you can determine all clocks are running below a maximum the=
n it
should be safe to lower the voltage. Currently, firmware actively monitors =
arm,
core, h264, v3d, isp and hevc to determine what voltage can be reduced to, =
and
if arm increases any of those clocks behind the firmware's back, when it ha=
s a
lowered voltage, a crash is highly likely.

As pointed out to me by RPi foundation engineers hsm/pixel aren't currently
being monitored, as driving a high resolution display also requires a high =
core
clock, which already sets an acceptable min voltage threshold. But that mig=
ht
change if needed.

Ultimately, from the DVFS, the safe way to change clocks from arm would be =
to
always use the firmware interface, which we're far from doing right now. On=
 the
other hand, AFAIK not all clocks have a firmware counterpart.

Note that we could also have a word with the RPi foundation and see if
disabling DVFS is possible (AFAIK it's not an option right now). Although I
personally prefer to support this upstream, aside from the obvious benefits=
 to
battery powered use cases, not consuming power unnecessarily is always big
plus.

As I comment above, not as simple as it seems. I suggest, for now, we only
register the clocks we're going to use and that are likely to be affected b=
y
DVFS. hsm being a contender here.

As we'd be settling on a hybrid solution here, which isn't ideal to say the
least, I'd like to gather some opinions on whether pushing towards a fully
firmware based solution is something you'd like to see.

We shouldn't create a special case for pllb. My suggestion here is that we
revert the commit that removed pllb from the mmio driver, in order to maint=
ain a
nice view of the clock tree, and register this as a regular fw-clk.

The only user to this is RPi's the cpufreq driver, which shouldn't mind the
change as long as you maintain the clk lookup creation.

On that topic, now that the clocks are available in DT we could even move
raspberrypi-cpufreq's registration there. But that's out of the scope of th=
is
series.

I'd really like more descriptive names here, sadly the firmware interface
doesn't provide them, but they are set in stone nonetheless. Something like
'fw-clk-arm' and 'fw-clk-hsm' comes to mind (SCMI does provide naming BTW).

See here for a list of all clocks:

Se my comment above WRT registering all clocks.
