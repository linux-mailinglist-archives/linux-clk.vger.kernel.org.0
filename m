Please Cc me on CLK API matters, as per my entry in MAINTAINERS.

The subject is the clk_get_rate() function, and as it is in the
section describing that function, I don't see it is ambiguous.

From what I remember, the restriction came after some discussion,
and the problem that on some platforms, the clock tree would not
be known prior to the clock being enabled (at that time, which
was before the "prepare" stuff got added.) Consequently, because
the child/parent relationships were not known, and PLLs were not
initialised, the rate that a particular clock would be ticking
could be different before and after it being enabled.

For this reason, it was decided that the only sensible approach
was to declare that the return value of clk_get_rate() on a
disabled clock is undefined.

That said, finding the discussion is proving difficult, so I may
be misremembering.
