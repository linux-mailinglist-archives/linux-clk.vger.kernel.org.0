Sorry for the delay, I've been busy with the switch to my new job.  I
haven't been doing much with the clocks recently, but hopefully I can
shed some light.

Linux doesn't drive changing the VPU clock.  It's controlled by the
firmware's turbo/undervoltage/temperature management thread, and the
Foundation wants to keep it that way, unfortunately (that way all
devices have the same temperature management, rather than relying on the
OS's behavior).

We do expose the VPU (aka bus or core) clock in upstream Linux, but if
you try to read its rate you just get some sample.  Don't try
propagating a rate change through VPU clock, it will not go well (Linux
doesn't control all the leaf clocks, so it would just be flipping whose
clocks get screwed up by rate changes, and you'd be racing the
firmware's thread).

Right now in the downstream tree they set up the peripherals using the
best-case core clock, so things only get clocked down from there:

    clk-bcm2835: Read max core clock from firmware
=20=20=20=20
    The VPU is responsible for managing the core clock, usually under
    direction from the bcm2835-cpufreq driver but not via the clk-bcm2835
    driver. Since the core frequency can change without warning, it is
    safer to report the maximum clock rate to users of the core clock -
    I2C, SPI and the mini UART - to err on the safe side when calculating
    clock divisors.
=20=20=20=20
    If the DT node for the clock driver includes a reference to the
    firmware node, use the firmware API to query the maximum core clock
    instead of reading the divider registers.
=20=20=20=20
    Prior to this patch, a "100KHz" I2C bus was sometimes clocked at about
    160KHz. In particular, switching to the 4.9 kernel was likely to break
    SenseHAT usage on a Pi3.
