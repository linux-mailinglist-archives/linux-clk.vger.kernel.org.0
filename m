Not sure if you are talking about Chip ID, Chip ID extension registers.
These are available also on SAM9X60.

Please add Nicolas in the loop on the next revisions of this series as this
should also be tested on SAMA7G5. I don't have a SAMA7G5 with OTP memory
populated.

Not needed, adding your compatible there is enough.
