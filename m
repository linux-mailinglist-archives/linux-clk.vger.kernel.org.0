Because those clock may be both critical and have other consumers which 
can be fully described in DT, i.e. a combination of the two 
aforementioned use cases.

The CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag does not imply the clock can only supply single 
device, rather the CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag indicates the clock must not 
ever be turned off. The clock can still supply multiple devices, some of 
them described in DT, some of them not.

If you were to unregister the clock from clock framework if they are 
critical, you wouldn't be able to handle the aforementioned use case.

There may be other consumers in DT, we _only_ want to make sure the 
clock are never turned off, ever.

The "no consumers in DT" and "never turn clock off" are orthogonal.

See above, I don't think not registering the critical clock is the right 
approach.
