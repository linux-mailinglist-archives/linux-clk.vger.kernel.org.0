I agree that the clock-bindings have the instructions on how to set
them.  If you check
arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/beacon-renesom-som.dtsi, there are some
examples of how to set the frequency.
In my instance,  the chip wasn't enabling the output by default, so I
needed to submit some patches upstream to make sure the device that
was being clocked by this device had get and enable functions to make
sure the clock chip would turn on the clock when requested.

I've reviewed the datasheet for the 6965, and it doesn't explicitly
show the multiplier, but the programmer's guide does appear to show
the existence of bit that when set, it will "double the reference
frequency for the Phase frequency detector" but on the programmer's
guide for the 6901, the same bit reads "Enables frequency doubler when
set to 1" so it's not clear to me that these functions are exactly the
same, but implies that it might be.  I'll need some time to test this,
but if I find it works, I can push a patch to this driver.  I added
Luca, as he is the maintainer for this driver as well.
