This is my initial goal, but I would still like good HDMI and video supp=
ort (including HW decode).=20

It took some refactoring and resequencing of (your) existing driver work=
 to get to this series, and I have left out the HDMI and separated the T=
CON code for the same reason, that initially I am intending to just supp=
ort RGB operation to an LCD. I do intend however to use the HDMI code ei=
ther in or out of tree but think that will be a much bigger/more complex=
 change to mainline given the current HDMI code is more invasive to the =
generic driver.

The YUV and AFBC changes seemed more self-contained and seemed reasonabl=
e approaches given that they were both features of the DE3 and up. I am =
happy either to split these into either 4 or 5 separate patches ie:

1a. refactor CSC code to prepare for YUV
1b. add YUV for DE3
2. refactor mixer enumeration and regmaps to support DE3+
3. add DE33
4. Add AFBC

My only reluctance is that that adds more work to manage multiple patche=
s which are logically grouped and in terms of ease of review, all these =
4 steps are in the current set in that order (apart from AFBC which is c=
ompletely standalone), and I don't think submitting them separately redu=
ces complexity. It however will reduce reviewer burden as you suggest, b=
ut this has been a slow process already.

I am happy to accept either process but this has been some time already =
now with lots of stylistic feedback but not much on the correctness of t=
he approach and code, and I am keen to get this landed.

Good to know, I hadn't appreciated that. Mostly relevant for video as yo=
u say and it would be good to land YUV support without scaling, then ext=
end subsequently, possibly when we get to the video engine?

Thanks, I was not aware of this either.

Thanks, again I wasn't aware. All my testing has shown remarkable stabil=
ity and there are some downstream users out-of-tree with good feedback, =
but would be happy to support an effort to improve this.
