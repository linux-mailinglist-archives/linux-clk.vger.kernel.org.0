Doesn't matter. The initial comment was about the rate changing when the cl=
ock
was enabled. I said reset here because any change on power on would assume =
some
default state it was returning to.

The clk_set_rate only runs clk_get_rate to see if any change needs to occur=
. If
the clock isn't enabled then this is likely part of startup or resume. The
likelihood of needing to change the rate in this scenario would be high any=
way.

There's no big deal, I was curious if there was a consensus around clock
initialization that could push this fix in a different direction.

Considering there doesn't seem to be any consensus I'm fine with moving for=
ward
with the initial cached rate workaround. I just need to rework it a bit to =
cover
the initial corner case outlined.
