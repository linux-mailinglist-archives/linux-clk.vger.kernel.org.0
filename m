Maybe pick <&pll 3> instead of <&pll 1> in my patch and merge the two
changes? Or drop clocks and clock-names from the example because
otherwise unrelated clocks are modified which shouldn't be done. The
result is below.

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: clk: Make example a bit clearer
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Previously the example used <&pll 2> in two places which made it harder
than necessary to understand why this clock gets the parent of
<&clkcon 0>. Also describe why <&pll 2> isn't reparented and <&clkcon 0>
gets no rate assigned.

 Configuring a clock's parent and rate through the device node that consumes
 the clock can be done only for clocks that have a single user. Specifying
