SM8350 GCC has 44 clocks marked as such downstream.

Makes sense, so this logic will have to consider both the hardware state
(or make assumptions thereof) and the clock votes in the kernel.

Which clock was this?

We should be able to assume that the bootloader will hand us a clock
tree that's functionally configured, so reparenting etc of the RCGs
should not cause issues because the old parent will be ticking and we
will explicitly start the new parent.

One case that might not be handled though is the externally sourced
clocks, where if you reconfigure the DSI phy without first parking the
RCG you might lock up the RCG. So I think that whenever we mess with
those clocks we need to make sure that the downstream RCGs are not
ticking off them.

Okay, makes sense then. But I don't think we want to shoot down clocks
at clock probe time.
