Yes, the subject should be made better.

I recently noticed the code was changed, I guess that I was missing
something there. After tracking the log, I found that there is a build
warning in the original implementation, and it was already fixed, but
it seems to me that there are still some situations there, please help
me to see the following illustration.

Let's go back to the version without '487dc7bb6a0c' fix. The
prci_clk_fu540 variable is defined in sifive-fu540-prci.h header,
however, fu540-prci.c includes this header but doesn't use this
variable, so the warnings happen.

The easiest way to do it is just removing this line, then the warning
could be fixed. But as the '487dc7bb6a0c' or this patch does, the code
should be improved, the prci_clk_fu540 variable shouldn't be defined
in the header, it should be moved somewhere.

Here is another situation I mentioned at the beginning, if we'd like
to put prci_clk_fu540 here, prci_clk_fu740 should be put here as well.
I guess you didn't do that because there is a bug in the original
code, fu740-prci.c misused the fu540-prci.h, so there is no build
warning on fu740. FU740 still works correctly by misusing the
fu540-prci.h header because fu740-prci.c doesn't actually use the
prci_clk_fu740 variable, like fu540 we talked about earlier.

The idea is that sifive-prci.c is the core and common part of PRCI,
and I'd like to separate the SoCs-dependent part into SoCs-dependent
files, such as fu540-prci.c and fu740-prci.c. The goal is if we add
new SoCs in the future, we can just put the SoCs-dependent data
structure in the new C file, and do as minimum modification as
possible in the core file (i.e. sifive-prci.c). It might also help us
to see all SoCs-dependent data in one file, then we don't need to
cross many files. Putting these two variables in sifive-pric.c is the
right thing to do, but that is why I separate them and make them
extern in this patch.

Many thanks for your reply.
