Right, but that alone already removes the ambiguity :)

If not calling clk_enable() prior to calling clk_get_rate() is ok, then
we don't *need* to call it, both are valid.

Therefore, the "you need to call clk_enable() before calling
clk_get_rate()" interpretation isn't the right one, right?

Right, but I guess that's ok, the CCF never claimed to support atomicity
in any way. That could also be the result of a parent changing its rate,
or a reparenting, etc.

Still, it means that it was the best estimate we could do when
clk_get_rate() was called. It just turned out to be short-lived.

In this case, core->parent is NULL, so we could argue that it's the same
case than clk_get_rate(NULL). It makes sense.

> or because the clk_op couldn't calculate it at the time of caching.

I guess this is what the discussion is all about, whether it's actually
something that we should find it acceptable or not.

=46rom what you're saying, it is indeed acceptable and thus clk_get_rate()
can return 0 not only from a NULL clock, but also if it's incapable of
figuring out a rate for that clock. We should thus document that
recalc_rate can indeed return 0 in such a case, and that users should
take this into account and not always expect a valid rate.

Would a documentation for recalc_rate like that:

Recalculate the rate of this clock, by querying hardware. The parent
rate is an input parameter. It is up to the caller to ensure that the
prepare_mutex is held across this call. Returns the calculated rate. If
the driver cannot figure out a rate for this clock, it must return 0.
Optional, but recommended - if this op is not set then clock rate will
be initialized to 0.

And for clk_get_rate() (in drivers/clk/clk.c):

Simply returns the cached rate of the clk, unless CLK_GET_RATE_NOCACHE
flag is set, which means a recalc_rate will be issued. Can be called if
the clock is enabled or not. If clk is NULL, or if an error occurred,
then returns 0.

Work for everyone?

The above is just enough for me. recalc_rate returning 0 is valid, and
should be taken properly into account.

Longer term I guess it makes sense to drop the rate caching, but I've
introduced enough clock regressions already for a couple of releases :)

A good workaround for now would be to set CLK_GET_RATE_NOCACHE for those
clocks.

Ok. So we can either group both the "we couldn't figure out a rate" and
the "our clock is NULL" case as the same case in clk_get_rate(), or we
can convert clk_get_rate() to return signed integers and a negative
error code. The latter seems much more intrusive to me and will probably
lead to a whole bunch of regressions, so I'd be more inclined to stick
to the former. Especially since drivers seem to either don't care or
treat 0 as an error already.
