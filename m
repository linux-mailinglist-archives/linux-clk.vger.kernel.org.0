The changes here need to be tested on affected platforms (ARMv7 and
ARMv8), when built as a modules on some types of regular distros (e.g.
Arch, Ubuntu). From each of such boot I would be happy to see number of
new dmesg warnings/errors plus number of probe deferrals.

Since the drivers could be switched to modules (and some distros might
do it), they might be hit by surprise regressions in boot performance
due to probe deferrals. This should be also checked on these platforms.
Geert pointed out before that clocks in many cases are not optional -
driver needs them and will wait defer.

Assuming of course that boot succeeds. Minor differences in boot speed
should not be a problem, I think, because distro anyway chosen
all-module approach so it accepts the penalty.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
