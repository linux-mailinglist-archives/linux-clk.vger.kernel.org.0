Don't get me wrong, I would like some clarification as well, but I guess
what I was trying to say is that clk_get_rate is such a mess when it
comes to what it's allowed to return or not already than trying to clean
up when it's allowed to be called is going to be a nightmare and you'll
break tons of platforms in the process.

Last time I tried, I ended up in a philosophical discussion with another
platform maintainer that went nowhere, and we ended up reverting the
patches.

So unless you get a maintainer that steps in and say what needs to be
done, and enforces it, my advice is you should workaround the issue.
