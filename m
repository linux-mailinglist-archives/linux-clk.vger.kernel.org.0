After thinking about it some more I realized there are definitely some
of the clocks we shouldn't disable even when unused, for example the
interconnect clocks. With interconnect drivers disabled the system
basically locked up entirely once the clock core disabled the clocks.

For now I fixed this by marking all of DEFINE_CLK_SMD_RPM() as
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED (essentially restoring the current behavior of the
driver). For MSM8916 these are exactly the interconnect clocks, but on
other platforms there are further clocks that might not need
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED. This could be still optimized later.

After running into the issue above I kind of agree with you. While
problems should be limited by marking the "rate" clocks as
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED, it's also possible that one of the platforms requires
one of the branch clocks to stay on to boot successfully.

I know for sure that this works properly on MSM8916, so maybe I should
make it opt-in and then we add it for each platform after validating it?
