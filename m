The clock name to DT index mapping must be described in the binding.

If there isn't a DT index for those intermediate clks then they should
be using a clk_hw pointer directly. The fw_name member matches an index
in the clock-names property, which has a 1:1 relationship to the DT
index.

If the parent isn't in DT then it can't use fw_name. There seems to be
some misunderstanding.

I think what you're saying is that zynqmp_get_clock_info() is building a
topology description for clks that the driver registers. But some of
those clks have parents that aren't registered by this driver and are
external to the device. The zynqmp firmware interface is string based,
not number based, so you have to keep "clock-names" DT property.

That's all OK.

You don't need to parse clock-names for the DT index if you take the
string from the zynqmp firmware and jam it into the fw_name when the
parent isn't a clk registered by this device. When the parent _is_ a clk
registered by this device, you should use a clk_hw pointer for that
other clk to indicate the parent. When it's a mixture of internal and
external you use struct clk_parent_data. When it's only internal, use
struct clk_init_data::clk_hws to avoid even considering having to parse
DT.

If you want to skip the string comparisons in the clk core, and I
suggest you do so, you can parse clock-names once, find the index for
each external clk, and then use that info when building the topology
returned from the zynqmp firmware to mark the parent as "external". Then
when you go to register all the clks you can use that info to build the
parent_data or parent_hws structures. It's unfortunate that the zynqmp
firmware interface is string based, but I understand it can't be
changed.

I looked at zynqmp_pm_clock_get_parents() and it looks like it's just a
bunch of numbers for the parent descriptions. If that's true, then there
aren't any external clks at all, and so clock-names and clocks shouldn't
be in the DT binding and you should just use clk_hw pointers everywhere.
Did I miss something?
