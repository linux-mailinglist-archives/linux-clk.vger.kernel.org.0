The WARN_ONCE vs. WARN is a trade off. Picking WARN has the downside to
(maybe) overflow your kernel log hiding the things you currently care
for. If you want to address the rounding "problems" making this a WARN
might be sensible.

The warning obviously doesn't fix anything. My eventual goal is to
answer the question in the initial mail in this thread. The motivating
situation is: Should I continue to tell patch authors who use
clk_get_rate() that they have to ensure that the given clk must be
enabled as the documentation suggests? And if yes: Can we please check
this automatically (e.g. with my patch or by returning 0 for a disabled
clk) and don't rely on human review to adhere to this rule.

Best regards
Uwe
