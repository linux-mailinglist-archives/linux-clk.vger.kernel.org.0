If this is how SCU firmware addresses the clock, I agree that it's worth
witching to this new bindings, which describes the hardware (SCU
firmware in this case) better, IMO.

It seems that there are several sets of clock type which apply to
different resources/devices?  If so, can you separate them a bit with
some comments to make the list easier for readers?
