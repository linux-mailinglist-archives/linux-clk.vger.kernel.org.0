Yes, that needs to be fixed. My approach was to drop the XO parent and
consider the clock to be off if it is fed by the XO.

That patch seems fine to me. Will it work if we take the force-enable
bit into account when considering the clock to be on or off?

I think this approach makes sense too (and might be preferable to
boot-time hacks).
On most of the platforms we are already resetting the MDSS as soon as
the mdss (root device) is being probed. Then the display is going to
be broken until DPU collects all the coonectors and outpus and finally
creates the DRM device.

But I think we should fix the get_parent() too irrespectively of this.
