If we decide to move them into sifive-prci.c (i.e. put it in where
it's referenced.), I worried that we might need to move all stuff
which are in fu540-prci.c and fu740-prci.c. Because 'prci_clk_fu540'
is referenced in sifive-prci.c, whereas '__prci_init_clocks_fu540' is
used by 'prci_clk_fu540', and the almost things in fu540-prci.c are
used by '__prci_init_clocks_fu540'. It seems to be a little bit
difficult to clearly decouple it for modularization which I want to
do. What this patch does might be a accepted way, I hope that you can
consider it again.

I couldn't see what are you pointing, do you mind give more details
about it? It seems to me that the match table is put in C file (i.e.
sifive-prci.c).
