The .init() is really for the clock itself, so it makes sense for it to
in the ops. Removing the init from the ops would just be another layer of
controller init, something we can deal with in the probe() function.

What I'm trying to do here is properly decouple what belongs in each.

That's already what I'm doing actually. I have the controller part which
position regmap so the clock part may get it regardless of where it
comes from (syscon, io or something else)

I think this is what I'm doing actually.

This is why I left the possibility for regmap to be "pre-populated" so it
continues to work the way it previously did.

I admit early clocks is a low priority for me since I only have one
controller like this and I do not expect more.

If cleaning up this particular case is important, then I could add
another level of init:
* A callback passed along the init data of the clock to get the regmap.
  That callback would be called by the .init() ops, if set.
  That can encode any quirks without polluting the ops.
* It will grow the init data so the change won't save memory anymore.
  This was more a bonus so I don't really mind. Maintainability is more
  important.
* If the callback is not set, then it goes through the default, as
  proposed here. This would avoid patching all the clk_regmap clock of
  every controller.

Agreed

The name registered in regmap_config itself is device specific, not
controller specific, since it can come from something else in the
platform (syscon or even aux devs), that why I think an independent
namespace is desirable -- Same goes the generic solution Conor is
working on I think.

I see what you mean and I agree. It does not operate on the hardware but
it does collect the resources it needs to operate the HW, and ideally
it should do just that - without controller quirks popping up there.

Anyway a callback passed in init data takes care of 'io vs syscon'
controller too, same as devres. I can go that route if this is what you
prefer. I thought devres was a more elegant solution but it is indeed
restricted to 'device enabled' controllers. 

The change will be a bit ugly in the syscon ones but I don't mind.
Is that fine for v2 ?
