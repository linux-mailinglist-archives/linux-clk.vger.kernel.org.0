Thanks for those clear explanations and for this series. As discussed, 
this approach looks good to me as it doesn't break our current strategy 
for dwmac clock integration. I don't know if those cyclic redundancies 
will be fixed one day but we can have a look on dwmac DT properties (the 
gain to change them, the effort to keep the backward compatibility, code 
readability, ...).

Your DT patches looks good. I'll merge them soon.
