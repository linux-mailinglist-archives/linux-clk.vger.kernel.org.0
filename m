All the more reason to not put the size in the DT, but imply from the
compatible. Unless it varies by instance...

Though I guess you would need DT updates anyways to use the new clock.

I would think you could walk the 0x4000 until you hit registers that
behave differently.

The register size / 0x4000 gives you the number of channels, too.

Another question, how do you know this is 1 block with N channels vs.
N blocks just happening to be next to each other in the memory map?
