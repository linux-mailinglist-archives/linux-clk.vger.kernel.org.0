Hi Stephen, thanks a lot for your info. I searched a bit and found
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-clk/msg06704.html .

I do not want to implement any userspace clock API, but user-space
control of extended features of a specific chip, currently missing in
the particular driver. Clock generators Si5340/1 (and many more, but
they are not my focus) can adjust output skew/delay on each output. Also
they allow fine-tuning the frequencies while running, by tiny
incremental steps. These features need to be controlled dynamically from
user space, by the application using them. None of the features iteract
with the in-kernel clock API. The fine-tuning control would not change
the set_rate/get_rate values, but adjust the real frequency, similarly
to alsa control 'PCM Rate Shift 100000' in snd-aloop loopback. So my
question is whether sysfs is the currently preferred interface for
specific-module control like this, or what other method should be used.

Thanks a lot,

Pavel.
