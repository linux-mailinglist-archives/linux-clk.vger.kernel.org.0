Hello Robin,

I am a bit ashamed to admit that I haven't fully considered the option of putting
the random infracfg stuff in the random infracfg stuff place.

This solution looks like being the most sensible thing that we can actually do to
patch up this bit.

Thanks a lot for the advice!!

Cheers,
Angelo
