Sorry I'm not understanding what your asking.
Should we be using some other method to ensure there is power to this device
before probingHow do I then ensure the dependency to that power supply?

I can't see why that part of the system can't be shut down, provided that inputs
are also isolated correctly when the regulator is disabled etc.
The data sheet says that input can execeed VDD / VDDOUT provide
clamp current ratings are observed.

It is also seems permissible to disable Vddout independently of Vdd (for some variants).
