Ok, so this driver must want the new API.

What is happening here though? The driver is setting 'disable_4kp60' at
bind/probe time based on a clk_round_rate() returning a frequency. That
returned value could change at runtime though based on rate constraints,
or simply because the clk driver decides that the wind is blowing
differently today and thus calling clk_set_rate() with that frequency
will cause the clk to be wildly different than before.

I don't understand how we can decide to disable 4kp60 at probe time. Why
doesn't the driver try to set the rate it wants (or the rate range it
wants) and then if that succeeds it knows 4kp60 is achievable and if not
then it rejects the attempt by userspace to set such a resolution.
