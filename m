Sorry, completely forgot. YUV420 HDMI code relies on my previous work, with=
 which
Maxime wasn't happy with:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sunxi/20230924192604.3262187-1-jernej.skrabec=
@gmail.com/

So unless switching HDMI to bridge ops is implemented, which also brings fo=
rmat,
YUV formatter and some other patches just add unused code, which isn't idea=
l,
especially if we decide to rework driver before that code can be put in acc=
eptable
state for all involved.

=46rom quick look, patches 5-13, 26 should be dropped for now. Not sure abo=
ut 1-4.

I'm fine with AFBC support going in, it's just one patch.

Correct.

Just be aware of one thing. Even if YUV buffer is rendered in 1:1 scale, vi=
 scaler
still needs to be configured. That's because U and V planes are subsampled =
and
need to be scaled to Y plane size. For unknown reason, that works just fine=
, but
if Y scale is bigger than 1, it all falls apart.

This should be implemented in atomic check.

Here you have some pointers how this values are actually set:
https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/linux-orangepi/blob/orange-pi-5.15-sun5=
5iw3/bsp/drivers/video/sunxi/disp2/disp/de/lowlevel_v33x/de330/de_top.c#L23=
2-L260

I think this is the biggest issue of this code. As soon as we solve it prop=
erly, we
have an ability to implement all remaining features at a later date.

Let's land DE33 support first since it's long overdue and then I'm happy to=
 discuss plans for moving forward.
