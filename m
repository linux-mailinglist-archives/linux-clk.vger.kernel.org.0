The three questions above are actually one problem here. It's not about=20
MC clock, because it's still available after these changes. And MC=20
driver can still get it in the probe function even the EMC driver isn't=20
there.

The problem is that without EMC driver after these changes. The PLLM=20
will have no client under it, which will cause the PLLM to be disabled=20
in the late init call of "clk_disable_unused". So the system will be stuck.

After this moving, the EMC driver will be always enabled by default. And=20
the DT change is necessary as well. The blob of EMC table is not=20
necessary, because it needs a firmware update. We will update the=20
firmware accordingly after the review settled and release it later.

In case of no EMC table blob, the driver can still be registered, but no=20
scaling function provided.

1. Currently, via debugfs.
2. No, we prefer to use Interconnect framework for that. The evaluation=20
is ongoing.
3. With Interconnect, the devices or peripherals can register on it to=20
request the BW. So we can fine-tune the BW requirements with the latency=20
allowance registers altogether to get better efficiency.

Thanks,
Joseph
