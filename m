What is "that patch"?

It would work to consider the rcg clk as on or off. During rcg clk
registration if a branch child is found to be enabled we would go and
write the force enable bit in the parent rcg. And similarly we would
modify the rcg clk_ops to set that bit whenever the clk is enabled and
clear it whenever it is disabled. This avoids the feedback mechanism
from confusing us about the enable state of the rcg, at the cost of
writing the register.

It wouldn't fix the problem that we have on Trogdor though. That's
because the display GDSC is turned off when the rotator clk is enabled
and parented to the display PLL, which is also turned off. We have to
either turn off the rotator clk, or switch the parent to something that
is always on, XO, or keep the display GDSC on until the rotator clk can
be turned off. On other SoCs we may need to turn off even more clks
depending on which ones the display GDSC is controlling.

Ok. I'm leaning towards this approach now because it seems like keeping
the clk at whatever it was set at boot isn't useful. If it becomes
useful at some point we can implement a better handoff mechanism. I have
some idea how to do that by using the 'clocks' DT property to find child
clks that haven't probed yet. I'll test out this alternate approach to
park shared clks at probe and send the patch.

Sure, but it becomes sorta moot if we force the parent to be XO.
