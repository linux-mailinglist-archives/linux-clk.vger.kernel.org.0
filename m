What I'm seeing after some tests is that the boot loader
(splash screen) sets PRCMU_DSI0ESCCLK to 9600000
(9.6MHz) and if I try to switch that to 19.2 MHz which the
component should be fine with (and a vendor kernel
is using it) things bug up.

A workaround that works is to set the clock to 9.6MHz
so it matches what the boot loader splash set it to,
the display works fine if I do this.

From what I can see the problem is maybe that the clock
framework is trying to re-initialize a PRCMU clock that was
already turned on, but I haven't looked closer.

Do you think that it could possibly be that the problem isn't
really that of disabling the clock, but actually that the code
re-enables a clock that is already enabled?

I.e. to switch the frequency of this clock we need to go
through a disable/set_rate/enable sequence, but as it is
now, we will issue set_rate() on a clock that is already
enabled, just that the framework isn't aware that is is
already enabled?

I.e. we would need something like regulator-boot-on
but for clocks, clock-boot-on;?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
