I can understand that.

To clarify further, what Shazad said about GCC_UFS_REF_CLKREF_CLK is correct.
This clock is not directly sourced by CXO, so it should be voted by the
_PHY_ driver separately along with CXO (which still feeds PHY). That's what I
represented in the binding.

That's the life for most of us :) Even with access to internal docs, it is
difficult to find the information we are looking for. Because, a very few people
know where the information is buried.
