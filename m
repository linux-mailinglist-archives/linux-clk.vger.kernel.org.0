dispcc is a hardware block powered by MMCX, so it is a consumer of it
and needs to control MMCX.

And in addition to needing MMCX to access the dispcc, the exposed
power-domain "MDSS_GDSC" is powered by the same MMCX and as such
MDSS_GDSC should be a subdomain of MMCX.


But what I was trying to say yesterday is that the power-domain property
should be sufficient and that we shouldn't need to drive MMCX to a
particular performance_state in order to access the registers.

Then as clients make votes on clock rates that requires higher
performance_state, they would describe this in their opp-tables etc.


But without any performance_state requests, pd->corner will in
rpmhpd_power_on() be 0 and as such powering on the power-domain won't
actually do anything. Similarly dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state(dev,
0) on an active power-domain from rpmhpd will turn it off.


So the reason why Dmitry is adding the required-opps to the binding is
to get rpmhpd to actually tell the hardware to turn on the power domain.
And I don't think this is in accordance with the framework's
expectations.

Bjorn
