That's up for discussion.

We can do it for new drivers and for existing drivers where we know we 
have multiple rails. It need not be a blanket sweep of all of the older 
drivers - for example 8996 or 8916.

That's why the example code I sent you checks for the validity of the 
callback.

Right now the only places we _require_ this sequencing are what

- sm8450 videocc/camcc
- x1e videocc/camcc
- sm8550/sm8650/sm8750 videocc/camcc ?

Certainly not the ~ 80 something clock drivers we have.

  and adding a callback

I understand your reluctance to change 80 drivers but, that's not the 
proposal.

We need only fix for new and existing - where its required.

My feedback is - still:

- Don't do qcom_cc_attach_pds twice, that is incorrect.
- Move the sequencing into core because it is replicated over and over
   again so it is a waste of time just copy/pasting over and over again.
- Describe the change correctly - you need the power rails to stay
   always on so you need to do qcom_cc_attach_pds prior to
   devm_pm_runtime_enable

And in fact this whole dance with pm_rumtime_dostuff() should go into 
common code - so that it gets fixed _once_

That's my honest and unfiltered feedback.
