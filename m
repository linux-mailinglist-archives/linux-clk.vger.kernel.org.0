There might be some limit to the underlying IP but we wouldn=E2=80=99t know=
.
What we know about the hardware comes from blackbox reversing, and that
doesn't suggest a particular limit to the number of channels we might
see on the SoC block in future.

Well strictly speaking the driver could do clock registration on-demand
at the cost of additional book-keeping, in which case we could drop
the property, but I would prefer we don=E2=80=99t do that. Rather than prov=
iding
validation the property simplifies drivers.

Another option is calculating the no. of channels from size of the reg
range, but I assume that=E2=80=99s worse than having the nchannels property=
.

Okay, will change.

There is about 5 registers per channel with 0x4000 stride between them,
blame Apple (or Samsung? I don=E2=80=99t know...).
