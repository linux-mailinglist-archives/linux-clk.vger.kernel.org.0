Maybe it's time to collapse the structs into macro definitions.
Probably a decade ago I expanded the macros that we had because we kept
modifying the struct members while settling on something that described
the clks. Now it doesn't seem very useful to do that because the structs
almost never change. Certainly the struct members aren't changing
rapidly. I'd start with a macro for branches, rcgs, and plls and see how
small it can become. Hopefully there aren't many parameters to the macro
so that it is still somewhat readable.
