I enjoy the ambiguity! :) This question has come up before and it
doesn't really matter. Drivers can call clk_prepare_enable() if they
want to be sure that clk_get_rate() is meaningful to them, or they can
not. The CCF returns a rate that it gets from calling recalc_rate, which
could be inaccurate for others reasons, either because some driver has
called clk_set_rate() after the clk_get_rate() or because the clk is an
orphan still and clk_get() succeeded, or because the clk_op couldn't
calculate it at the time of caching. Indeed the CCF doesn't try to
recalc the rate after enabling the clk. Maybe we should do that? It
would mean that we have to schedule a work from the enable path to
update the rate accounting outside of any atomic context.

Just thinking out loud, the simpler solution is to probably drop all
rate caching in the CCF and get the frequency on a clk_get_rate() call.
It complicates some of the core though when we check to see if we need
to update clk rates. We could have some middle ground where drivers
indicate that they want to update their cached rate because it's valid
now (either from their enable path or from somewhere else). This may be
nice actually because we could have clk providers call this to force a
recalc down the tree from where they've updated. I think the qcom
DisplayPort phy would want this.

A NULL clk isn't an error. We use NULL in the CCF to indicate that it's
an optional clk. Returning 0 from clk_get_rate() is not an error. If
clk_get() returns an error pointer then it's an error. And NULL isn't an
error value per PTR_ERR() (because NULL =3D=3D 0 when casted, this isn't
golang).

Again, NULL isn't an invalid clk handle.

I think this is all fine.
