What advantage do we gain?

This looks like a disadvantage. Are we reporting the frequency in kHz to
the clk framework?

I'm wondering if a clk provider should be created at all here. Who is
the consumer of the clk? The phy driver itself? Does the clk provided
need to interact with other clks in the system? Or is the clk tree
wholly self-contained?

Can the phy consumer configure the output frequency directly via
phy_configure() or when the phy is enabled? I'm thinking the phy driver
can call clk_set_rate() on the parent 'rfclk' before or after setting
the bits to control the output rate, and use clk_round_rate() to figure
out what input frequencies are supported for the output frequency
desired. This would avoid kHz overflowing 32-bits, and the big clk lock
getting blocked on some other clk in the system changing rates.

BTW, what sort of phy is this? Some networking device?
