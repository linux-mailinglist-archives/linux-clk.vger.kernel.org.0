Whew, glad I could help.

Good indeed :)

I CCed you on an ongoing conversation with Victor in

Re: [PATCH v7 2/7] Revert "clk: imx: clk-imx8mp: Allow media_disp pixel 
clock reconfigure parent rate"

let's continue the discussion there. I hope we can reach some sort of a 
way forward there, that works for everyone.
