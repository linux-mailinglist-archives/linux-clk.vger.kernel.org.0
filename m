No, these are separate problems. MC driver queries the clock rate during
the probe to configure memory arbitration. In your case the clock rate
is always zero for MC.

This and the above are very compelling reasons to *NOT* register the
clock from the EMC driver. You shall move all the clock stuff into the
clock driver. Please see T124 EMC driver and what is done for the
upcoming T30 EMC driver [1] for the example, borrow parts that fit best
for T210.

Anyone could change the default kernel configuration. Kernel shall boot
and work fine with older device-tree's and any custom config after
update. You should not break someones established setup without a good
reason and you don't have one here.

Devfreq is the driver for the ACTMON hardware unit. This unit tells the
driver when memory clock rate need to go higher or lower, depending on
overall memory clients activity. Currently the tegra-devfreq driver
supports T124 only, it will support T30 starting with v5.3. AFAIK, it
shouldn't be difficult to add support for T210 as well.

IIRC, the new Interconnect API is another away of conveying different
requirements between devices. All Tegra's have knobs for memory
configuration tuning, but there is no real need to change the default
good-enough configuration for the time being in upstream.

AFAIK, there is only one memory client that is really very sensitive to
available memory bandwidth - Display Controller. The PM QoS memory
bandwidth API is more than enough for the easy start and it's all
internal to kernel, hence it will be possible to replace the PM API with
something more advanced later on by as-needed basis. That's what I'm
currently targeting for T20-T124. The PM QoS API could coexist with the
Interconnect API (or whatever else) without any troubles, so it won't be
a problem if you'll decide to pull into other direction for T210.

AFAIK, the latency allowance config should be similar on all Tegra's
starting from T30. Will be awesome if you'll do all the hard job of
bringing up the fresh new API for T210, it always easier to follow by
example.
