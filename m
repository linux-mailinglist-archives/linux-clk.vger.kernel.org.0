Hello everyone,

Thank you for all these feedback and discussion about my patches.

Thank you for this suggestion. The issue is that clocks are registered 
at an early stage of the boot so using initcalls is too late for the 
clock differentiation :(

It would be a great idea indeed if there was not this clock registration 
too soon for initcalls.

I am currently running out of ideas to propose a better solution than 
this V1. Is anyone has any recommendation to handle that? I would really 
appreciate :)

Thank you in advance!
Best regards,
