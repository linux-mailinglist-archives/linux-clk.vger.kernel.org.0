Ok.

That matches what Ilya found (there were some more off-list messages
because of HTML mail issues). I suspected, that HCLK_SD (which is
sourced from SCMI) might need HCLK_NVM.

I see the same message for AV1 and I've also seen failed idle
message with the rockchip kernel. I have not yet debugged what is
going on with that.

Can you test again using rk3588-test [0] (which is based on today's
master branch) from today as base? Ideally it should work with your
Orange Pi 5, since it contains "clk: rockchip: rk3588: mark hclk_nvm
critical".

I also worked on a cleaner solution for the issue you described and
integrated it in the patch adding proper gate clock support. So
please also test with HCLK_NVM not being marked as CRITICAL.

commits/rk3588-test

If everything is fine I will prepare a v9.

Thanks for the detailed analysis.
