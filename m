The original patch from Adrian that my patch is based on indeed had 1 <=
p <= 4. I did some digging but I haven't found the reason why this was
changed to 1 <= p <= 7 in the patch I upstreamed. I can imagine that at
some point we realized that we also got suboptimal rates and therefore
changed it, but I don't know.

I gave the table precedence in case it contains qualified known good
values. If these values turn out to be not so good after all then I
suggest that we remove them.
