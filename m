Using clk_hw->clk until we have clk_hw_get_clk() is fine for now.
Various drivers do that already and I hope that a simple coccinelle
script can figure out how to convert that to the new function.l Is it
much work to introduce this API now? I thought it would be fairly simple
to do it but I haven't looked deeply.
