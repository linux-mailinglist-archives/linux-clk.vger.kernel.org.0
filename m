Subject: [PATCH RESEND v4 0/9] clk: cs2000-cp: add dynamic mode and more features

[Resending this series which still applies cleanly to both clk/clk-next
 and 5.16-rc5. We're using these patches in production for a while.
 All DT patches are Acked-by already by Rob; what left is a review of
 the implementaion bits.]

This patch series adds support for dynamic mode, configurable clock
skip settings and a tranisition to regmap.

The most significant change is the additional support for dynamic mode.
Currently, the driver only supports static mode in which the (currently
mandatory) CLK_IN clock input is not used by the hardware.

Unlike v3 of this series, the patch stack now maintains full
compatibility with existing bindings. Rather than infering the mode of
operation through the presence of an optional clock, the driver now
parses a new DT property to enable the dynamic mode.

Rob, I left your Reviewed-by in 1/9 as that is untouched since v2. I'd
much appreciate a review of the other 3 patches that concern
dt-bindings.


Thanks,
Daniel
