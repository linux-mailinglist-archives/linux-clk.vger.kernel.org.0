I think we need something like gpio-hog, except for clock. Some clk-hog 
maybe ? That would be useful not only here, but also for things where 
some output generates clock for random stuff which cannot be described 
in the DT for whatever reason (like e.g. the SoC is used as a substitute 
for CPLD XTAL and the CPLD isn't connected to the SoC in any other way).
