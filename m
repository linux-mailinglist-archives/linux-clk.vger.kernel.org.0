So use it only for this, nothing else. Use it only to check during
cleanup that you need to do the cleanup as init was previously done.

Draw it to me, please, where exatly there is a problem. I'm still
convinced that with the proper ordering of init/cleanup flows,
you'll get all you need, without any flag use.

"it is slow" is quite vague description of what's wrong with the
locking.
