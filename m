I wasn't aware of clock-critical DT prop, but it seems deprecated and 
not generic enough anyway.

The problem is the other way around -- the SoC clock IPs often have a 
couple of general purpose clock routed to various SoC IO pins, those 
clock can be used for any purpose, and those are already registered with 
kernel clock framework. Some devices save on BoM and use those general 
purpose clock to supply clock networks which are otherwise not 
interacting with the kernel, like some CPLD for example. Since from the 
kernel point of view, those clock are unused, the kernel can turn those 
clock OFF and that will make the entire device fail.

So this critical-clocks property permits marking clock which must not 
ever be turned OFF accordingly.
