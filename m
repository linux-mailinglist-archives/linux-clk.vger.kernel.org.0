Well, is an SMT socket on the board an EXT pin?
Which is why I prefer PANEL.

PANEL label must match the name on the panel. User can take the card
into their hand, look at the front, and there should be a label/sticker/
/engraving which matches exactly what the kernel reports.

If the label is printed on the board it's a BOARD_LABEL, if it's the
name of a trace in board docs it's a BOARD_TRACE, if it's a pin of 
the ASIC it's a PACKAGE_PIN.

If it's none of those, or user does not have access to the detailed
board / pinout - don't use the label.
