clk_smd_rpm_handoff() will ensure that all SMD clocks are enabled, and
at max speed during rpm_smd_clk_probe(). Once clients starts actually
voting for rates that will change.

(Un)fortunately as we don't provide an implementation of is_enabled()
clk_disable_unused() won't try to turn them off. This similar to a
problem I have elsewhere, for which I proposed:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20211203035436.3505743-1-bjorn.andersson@linaro.org/

We should at some point introduce this for the SMD clocks as well.


However, we have two problems:
1) Compiling e.g. the interconnect provider as a module would mean that
clk_disable_unused() kicks in before the client has had a chance to vote
for the clock.

2) One client may enable the clock during its probe and then disable it.
Being the last active user the clock framework happily turns off the
clock.


For both of these cases, we need to ensure that the clocks aren't
disabled until sync_state() kicks in.

Bjorn
