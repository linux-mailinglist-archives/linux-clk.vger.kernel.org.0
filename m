It depends. The CCF isn't the only implementation of the clk API, so
some drivers want to maintain API compatibility and call clk_enable()
before getting the rate to make sure the rate is valid. If all other clk
API implementations are removed or made to work without calling
clk_enable() we should be able to update the clk.h documentation.

I don't think there's anything to update.

What would the driver return besides 0 if the rate can't be calculated?
UINT_MAX? Does the framework care that the rate couldn't be calculated?
Weakening "must" to "should" or saying it "will most likely return 0" is
better. But again I don't see much point in clarifying here. 0 Hz is a
valid frequency. Maybe we should just say that 0 is valid?

We should remove the clk_get_rate() documentation in clk.c and let the
clk.h documentation be the one that is used. That will clarify that
clk.c implements the API in clk.h. I've been meaning to clean up the
documentation so I'll hack on that tomorrow and see if I can make this
better.

It's not a good workaround. The clk flag isn't used internally. That's
the problem. It's only used for callers of clk_get_rate(), but we have
rate setting logic where a child doesn't know that the rate should be
recalculated for the parent. It's also not a transitive flag, so if a
clk with the flag set has children we don't care that clk_get_rate() is
called on those children when it should really call up to the parent and
figure out how high to go before calculating the frequency down. This is
where an API that pushes the information to the framework makes sense so
that we can push the update instead of pull it on clk_get_rate().
Anyway, it's a problem for another day.

Agreed. We can try to work around the "not ready to figure out the rate"
problem by implementing EPROBE_DEFER for clks that are orphans. That
needs some thought around cases where clks have parents that aren't
described in the kernel and we want to reparent them via clk_set_rate()
or clk_set_parent() or their parent is provided by the driver getting
the clk (this latter case is a head spinner). In general indicating this
not fully registered state through clk_get_rate() is wrong though, hence
the decision to make clk_get_rate() always return something valid and
have the "don't know" case be returning zero.
