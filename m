This one indeed does everything in the enable and I could agree it is
fishy, but since it supports only a single rate I don't think it is a
problem. Even if it had a proper set_rate(), it would not change your
problem since it would still return 0 until some consumer actually needs
its parameter to change.

No, they don't expect anything. They will return 0 until they are set
with a an actual rate. I don't think returning 0 should be
problem and it has not been so far.

I understand the ambiguity you mentioned above. If the framework decides
it is clearly forbidden to return 0, we'll change.

Still I don't think it would be wise. What are the alternative if you
can't compute a rate ? return 1 ? This looks aweful to me. At least 0 is
a clear indication that the clock is not in a working state.

> and hdmi_pll_dco because it will always return 0,

It is a read-only clock - whatever we do in CCF, it is not going to
change. CCF has always supported RO clocks.

I'm all for managing the display clocks from CCF but it has proved tricky
so far. Maybe it will someday.

Being a read-only clock, the value is what it is and CCF should
deal with it gracefully. It has so far.

If the driver actually managing the clock is not compiled in, then the
clock will never be set, and it should not be a problem either.

Those initial parameters are "magic" analog setting which don't have an
impact on the rate setting. The initial rate of the clock is never set
by the clock driver on purpose.

It is done by other drivers or controllers, yes. It does not make it
right (again, it is just my opinion). Rate should never be set by the
clock driver or the clock controller - Those should just implement what
consumer wants. I would agree it sometimes proves tricky to hold onto
this.

Taking one of the example above:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/nxp/clk-lpc32xx.c#L1550

I think it would be better to have an "assigned-clock" on the related
PLL in the USB node of the platform DT. That way the PLL is set when
needed.

If we go down the road of "others are doing it, so why not ?", I think Marek
initial regression report mentioned Exynos too ;)

As it is the clock are usable and it did not break anything so far.

I have no problem updating the drivers if need be. I do have a problem
with the framework changing and requiring the clock driver to set an
initial rate to make it happy.
