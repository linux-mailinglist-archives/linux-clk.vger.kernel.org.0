Looking again at the implementation of the controller, there is a clear
indication in patch 3 that the controller interface is the same as the
AXG and that the above statement is true.

The AXG had 8 master clocks wired in. The A1 just has 5 - and 3 grounded
master clocks. This is why you to had to provide a mux input table to
skip the grounded inputs. You would not have to do so if the controller was
properly declared with the 8 master clock input, as it actually is.

It also shows that it is a bad idea to name input after what is coming
in (like you do with "dds_in" or "fclk_div2") instead of what they
actually are like in the AXG (mst0, mst1, etc ...)
