Yes, I thought that was in my cover letter

Not really. As with all C code, there are many way to do things.
Your way could work, mine too.

As explained in the previous mail, what I propose guaranteed to specific
to each clock instance. It's a fairly usual and simple way to give a
placeholder to the instance of something.

Things gets complicated with your way if the clock declaration uses
static data and there there multiple instance of it.

In the end that was merely a suggestion, so let's spend to much time on
this. If don't want it, that's fine. I'll just drop it.
