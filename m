...which is not what happened here.

By using Co-developed-by and a Signed-off-by one would state that
Rajendra certifies the origin of any additions done by Ilia and Loic.


Instead, Rajendra certified the origin of the original patch
(presumably) per 11.a by his s-o-b, then Ilia took the patch in whole or
part and certified that he can contribute it per 11.a or 11.c with his
s-o-b, then finally Loic should do the same, by adding his s-o-b.

As such we should see three Signed-off-by here, preferably with [name:
changelog] entries inbetween to document any modifications done to the
patch.

Bjorn
