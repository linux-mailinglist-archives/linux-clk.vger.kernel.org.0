Yes we should add a clk_hw_get_clk() API that takes a device pointer and
a string name, mirroring the clk_get() API but cutting out the part
where we have to go through the provider to find it.

This is so that one day in "the future" we can remove hw->clk and make
that an internal detail that struct clk_hw can't see because we go
through the clk_hw::clk_core pointer instead.
