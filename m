I have to correct myself here a bit. While using my current board .dts fpr 
imx8mp works with this patchset, things change if I apply Lucas' HDMI patchset 
[1] and enable HDMI devices. In this case I get the following errors:
> hdmi_pclk: recalc_rate returned a null rate
> fsl-samsung-hdmi-phy 32fdff00.phy: error -EINVAL: failed to register clock
> fsl-samsung-hdmi-phy 32fdff00.phy: register clk failed
> fsl-samsung-hdmi-phy: probe of 32fdff00.phy failed with error -22

The offending patch is the last one 'clk: Prevent a clock without a rate to 
register'.

Best regards,
Alexander
