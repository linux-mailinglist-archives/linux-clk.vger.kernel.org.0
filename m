We have 'suppress_bind_attrs' for that. What dynamic binding are you
thinking about?

Using the auxiliary bus is about getting better code review on the
subsystem specific parts of a device. I'm not going to be paying a lot
of attention to the clk parts of this driver if it is outside
drivers/clk. Making this change helps with better code review.

The Kconfig symbol could be the same for the clk part and the phy part,
and this is already split to a different file. It seems that your
argument for keeping the clk file in the phy directory is because
they're part of the same phy device. Do you expect to get clk driver
review on the clk parts with the clk implementation in a different
directory?

We want to get rid of the clk pointer stashed in clk_hw. Using
clk_hw_get_clk() lets us easily change that and not need to change this
driver. I don't quite understand why you need to generate a clock ID.
Are you concerned about passing in the 'con_id' argument? That string
can be anything.
