Argh! I forgot to put back disabling unused clks. This patch is garbage
and doesn't actually work. I started directly writing things with devmem
and saw that the branch bits are correct. The status bit in the rcg
changes when the corresponding branch is enabled.

It seems that rot must be parked on XO, otherwise mdp branch will fail
to enable after late init. I was hoping these two clks weren't related,
but they must be related somehow. I've parked rot on XO right after
disp_cc_pll0 is disabled and that also works.

My guess is the GDSC is restoring rcg registers, and that restoring
requires the source clk to be running (maybe they hardcoded that
requirement in the hardware). In the case of rot, the source clk is
disp_cc_pll0, which is always enabled during boot. When I hack it so
that disp_cc_pll0 is disabled at the end of dispcc probe, and rot is the
only clk still sourcing from it, nothing is busted until the gdsc powers
off, saves state, and then powers on again. That's the case where I
reported the stuck clk warning happens early, before late init. Once the
gdsc powers on the second time, it must wedge the rcg hardware and
affect mdp even though mdp was parked on XO.

Fun! This must be why qcom didn't want to have dirty registers. It must
confuse the gdsc hardware and cause it to restore the clk to the parent
that isn't enabled.

BTW, I tried changing the rcg source for rot after the mdp branch is
stuck off, and the rot rcg goes from reporting root off, to reporting
root is on, which is weird. Maybe that's just showing the rot rcg is in
some sort of wedged state as well.

So long story short, I think I understand the problem now. The gdsc is
saving and restoring the register contents, and enabling the rcg clks
when it does so. If that runs into some stuck rcg problem, it will wedge
the clks in weird ways. The only safe thing to do is make sure that when
the gdsc is turned off, all the rcgs are parked on sources that are
going to be enabled when the gdsc powers on the next time. For now,
we've decided that source is XO, because it is simple. It seems like
that means we need to park all shared rcg clks at registration time.
Or we need to teach the clks about their gdsc and switch rcgs over to
the safe source when disabling the gdsc.

Parking at init is easy, we call clk_rcg2_shared_disable() from the init
routine, and that parks the clk and stashes the config register. I just
don't know if that causes some sort of problem for bootsplash logic. The
mdp clk could be running quite fast, and we'll basically force it over
to XO immediately. It may be better to teach the gdsc code to park the
rcgs when disabling the gdsc. Then we can maintain the mdp clk rate out
of boot for as long as the gdsc is enabled out of boot, and we contain
the "fix" to where the problem is, gdsc can't restore a clk sourcing
something that's off. If we did this we still need to fix the parent
mapping at clk registration, i.e. parked_cfg needs to be read from the
hardware so that get_parent works.
