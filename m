I missed that part. If the old way stills works then we stay in the
halfway state which is undesirable. It's better to just finish a
transition.

The struct clk_init_data _can_ be thrown away or reused, but it isn't
always done that way.

Sure. I wonder if we should make it a 'const void *data' member of
struct clk_init_data so it can be anything and then either take a flag
day to pass that to the struct clk_ops::init() function or set the
struct clk_hw::init member to NULL after the init function is called. If
we're concerned about bloating clk_init_data then we could introduce
another two registration APIs that take a data argument and then pass
that to the init function.

 int clk_hw_register_data(struct device *dev, struct clk_hw *hw, const void=
 *data)
 int of_clk_hw_register_data(struct device *dev, struct clk_hw *hw, const v=
oid *data)

or we could wrap the init data in a container struct in the drivers and
move the setting of struct clk_hw::init to NULL after calling the init
function.

	struct clk_driver_init_data {
		void *data;
		int (*driver_init_function)(struct clk_hw *hw);
		int (*regmap_driver_init_function)(struct clk_regmap *rclk);
		etc...

		struct clk_init_data init;
	};

Then the clk provider can use container_of(). If we did this we could
even copy the contents of struct clk_hw::init into the driver specific
wrapper that lives on the stack, repoint the struct clk_hw::init pointer
to the stack copy, and then all the logic can live in the clk provider
driver that registers the clk.

This last option may be the best because it saves memory by not
increasing the size of 'struct clk_init_data' and doesn't require a flag
day to change the function signature of struct clk_ops::init(), even if
there's only a handful of those right now. What do you think?
