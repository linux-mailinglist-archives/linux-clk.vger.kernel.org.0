I imagine we debated the need for a DT property when critical clocks was 
added to the kernel.

The justification given in this patch was for an SoC input which should 
get described so that the clock is handled and kept enabled properly.

The CPLD case would be more interesting, but is there an actual need or 
just a possible case?

You could use the 'protected-clocks' property here. Maybe that's a bit 
overloaded between can't access and don't turn off. But what it means is 
really up the clock controller.
