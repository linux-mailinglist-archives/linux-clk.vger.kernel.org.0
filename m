Is the output skew/delay to control clk phase?

Can you share more details on the application?

Given that you're comparing to alsa control, is this for some audio
processing feature? Perhaps it needs to be controlled via alsa then and
eventually call into the clk driver to fine tune the clk that the
sound driver consumes.
