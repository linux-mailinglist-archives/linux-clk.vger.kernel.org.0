For now, this is not an issue with TI SoC:s at least, I think we only 
have like 64 parents at max for muxes.

I haven't done measurements lately, but it provides pretty drastic 
improvement. On am65x for example, it cuts the scan time from bit more 
than 1 second to couple of hundred milliseconds. I don't have 
measurements for the new j721e SoC, but I would believe the improvement 
is even more with that one.

It might also be worth thinking whether some sort of lazy clock probe 
would be possible... now we register everything at one go, but would it 
be possible to only register / reparent clocks once they are actually 
requested by some driver?

Ok looks good to me, thanks.
