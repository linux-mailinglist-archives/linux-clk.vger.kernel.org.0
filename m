*Many* thanks for addressing this issue so quickly!

I don't think Rob's ack should be present, he hasn't approved _this_
version of the patch.

This paragraph looks more an implementation description than a hardware
description.

I suggest something like (possibly better rephrased):

It is recommended to specify the two properties that describe the
hardware. The lack of them leaves the value unspecified and thus opens
to the risk of future incompatibilities, depending on implementation
details.

Saying "Disable the shutdown function" leaves a hole, it is not telling
what gets enabled. I'd rephrase using positive logic:

  Enable the OE (output enable) function for the SD/OE pin. This...

But there are too many "enable" words in it now, it's confusing, so why not:

  Choose the OE (output enable) function for the SD/OE pin. This...

And change correspondingly the idt,enable-shutdown description:
s/^Enable/Choose/.

Also it would be nice to declare in DT that the two flags are mutually
exclusive (same for idt,output-enable-active-*).
