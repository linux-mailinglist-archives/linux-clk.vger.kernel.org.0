I agree with your assesment. Both DVFS and overheating/overvoltage protecti=
ons
will cause trouble, if not, make a Linux solution impossible while using th=
e
Foundation's firmware.

Please note that, as Stefan says, it'd be nice to keep track of those argum=
ents
somewhere in the commit messages.

Nicolas
