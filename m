Yeah, indeed the range isn't propagated to the children yet. This wasn't
the case before my series either, so I wouldn't consider it a
regression.

=46rom a current-state point of view, that makes sense.

Still makes sense :)

I still don't get where exactly the 8 multiplier is enforced? Is it in
vpll_int? If so, then why is it reporting a rate of 1.5-3.0 GHz, whereas
its child clock that is supposed to halve the rate has 100MHz?

We can't really do that in the framework, because we can't really know
the capabilities of the clocks at a generic level using any of the
clocks operations. Indeed some clocks won't affect the rate ("pure"
gate, muxes), and some will.

Figuring out the rate range for those that don't affect it is trivial,
but for those who do you can't know how it affects the rate. Plus, PLL
will typically have a narrower range of operation than the extremum you
can achieve by using the larger divider and smaller multiplier for
example.

So I think you can't really expect an obvious relationship between the
parent range and the child range. So it should be reported by the
driver, like you did, by calling clk_hw_set_rate_range().
