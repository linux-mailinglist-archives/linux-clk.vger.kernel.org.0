So, if I was to rephrase, gp0_pll_dco and hifi_pll_dco expect someone to
call clk_set_rate() before clk_get_rate() to have it return anything
other than 0.

No, the alternative would be to initialize the clock to something
sensible before registering it (or in init).

Yes, if a clock has a rate of 0Hz it's entirely useless. And if it's
useful in anyway, it should report its current rate. Read-only or not.

Again, it depends on what you expect from clk_get_rate(). If it can only
report a rate of 0 on error, then it's definitely a problem.

And it's not because it was done before that it wasn't just as
problematic then.

It's still fundamentally the same: whatever is there at boot isn't good
enough, so you change it to have a somewhat sensible default.

Both are valid. Assigned-clocks is arguably more fragile, but that's not
really the point.

Yes, he did mention exynos as well, but the issue was entirely
different.

Exynos had the issue that req_rate wasn't updated whenever a clock
wasn't orphan anymore because it changed parent. It's fixed in patch 10.

Out of the drivers I tested this week (sunxi-ng, exynos, omap3, qcom,
imx6, imx8 and g12b), only meson is in this case.

Anything but the abstraction.

I mean, the alternative is changing the semantics of clk_get_rate(), and
all the call sites. Fixing one inconsistent driver definitely seems
preferable.
