Ah, just saw this part in downstream
https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/la/kernel/msm-4.19/-/blob/LA.UM.9.12.c25-028=
00-SMxx50.QSSI13c28.0/drivers/clk/qcom/clk-alpha-pll.c#L2443-2463

That's quite different to the simple

	clk_alpha_pll_write_config(regmap, PLL_USER_CTL(pll),
							config->user_ctl_val);

that's in upstream.

Also explains makes it clear that .user_ctl_hi_val is not applicable to
this agera PLL.

From looking at camcc-sm7150, I guess they have the same problem over
there. A bunch of post_div and _mask's set, but no .user_ctl_val set for
PLL2. But camcc-sc7180 is fine though.

Luca
