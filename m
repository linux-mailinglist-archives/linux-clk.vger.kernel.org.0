Yes, the firmware has a call that allows to query the boundaries of a
given clock it manages, and we then used whatever value it returns to
set the clk_hw rate range.

See https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/bcm/clk-rasp=
berrypi.c#L287

That would work for me

Is it really an OPP?

My understanding at least is that an OPP table is a discrete set of
frequencies that a device can operate at, but you still need the
frequency generator somewhere else?

What we're discussing here definitely looks more like a clock to me:
it's is the frequency generator, and can expose a continuous set of
frequencies between a range. It just turns out that depending on a
parameter that range changes a bit, and it then affect our capabilities.
