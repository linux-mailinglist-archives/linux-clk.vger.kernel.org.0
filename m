Right now that=E2=80=99s what I am inclined to use in v2.

We don=E2=80=99t. We only see Apple describe it as such in their devicetree=
, and
so far for all practical purposes it could be one block.

I guess if we derive the number of channels from register size, there=
=E2=80=99s
the fallback of breaking up the nodes per channel in future.
