Hmm, that is indeed a problem. That's why I think there should be some
kind of NOCACHE flag for almost all the types of clocks. For example,
in this case, it makes sense for the core to check the bit in the register
and then disable the parent based on that instead of relying on the refcount.
Anyway, that's something that needs to be added in the CCF.

Yeah, for now, I think we can go with Adam's patches. But longterm, I would
like to remove the special case of the uart clocks we have right now in all
the i.MX clock drivers.
