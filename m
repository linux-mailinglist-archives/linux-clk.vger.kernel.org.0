That was what I initially wanted to do. However I asked MTK whether the
system would work fully without systimer, and apparently it is used during
suspend (presumably it is supposed to be running?), so making it not
functional was a bit concerning.

That said, I do plan to rework the systimer stuff. The /2 divider is
actually internal to the systimer block, and should not have been modeled
the way it is now. Notably, the divider is actually variable. It is
only configured and locked by the bootloader.

For this I think we have two options:

a. Move the /2 fixed factor clock into a standalone device node, like
   what was done for the MT8195

b. Rework the systimer to internalize the divider, and thus moving the
   systimer input clock to osc26M.

Either one is outside the scope of this series. Option a. works especially
well for MT8192, as the configurable divider was removed from the systimer
block (only for this chip).

As mentioned above, I do have some plans to rework the stuff, but it is
kind of beyond the scope of this series, as it changes the device tree
binding and ABI.
