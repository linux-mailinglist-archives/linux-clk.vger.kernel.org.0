So you have a specific device? Why it is not part of name and compatible?

Exactly. The names xlnx,clocking-wizard and xlnx,clk-wizard-1.0 are
therefore not specific enough and mixing different devices.

I don't think so. Let's skip for now "clk" and "clocking" differences
and assume both are "clocking". You have then compatibles:

xlnx,clocking-wizard and xlnx,clocking-wizard-1.0

and you said these are entirely different blocks.

There is no way this creates readable DTS.

Krzysztof
