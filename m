I mainly posted it to get a response from Qualcomm on what's going on. I
haven't tried to fix the audio driver so far, but I can certainly look
into it. The audio clk driver keeping XO on doesn't seem to matter for
power because we're hitting the deepest of sleeps on Trogdor boards.

I also realized that due to clk adoption logic we can't be certain that
this driver's suspend function will be called after other clk providers
that consume XO run their suspend functions. We can probably assume clk
consumers that aren't providers will probe after clk-rpmh, so this check
is generally safe because we don't have clk providers disabling clks
during their suspend functions. It's just not totally safe.

Maybe this is a good reason to add some sort of suspend op to clk_ops
and then call that during system wide suspend.
