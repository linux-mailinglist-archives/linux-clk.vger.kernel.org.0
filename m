Then maybe the compatibles (and device names) should have that fpga/pl
technology used to differentiate between them?

Yes, although we might misunderstand what PL technology is. 28/16/7 nm
is the size of transistor or the process. Even two different processes
can use same type of technology, e.g. FinFET:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_nm_process
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_nm_process

You could have very similar (or even the same) designs done in 28 nm and
16 nm. Does it mean these are entirely different devices? Not
necessarily... Maybe they are, maybe not, but is the size of process
differentiating? I actually don't know what's there in 28/16/7, I am
just saying that number alone might not mean different technology.
Programming API could be the same, inputs/outputs could be the same.
Just the size of transistor is different...
