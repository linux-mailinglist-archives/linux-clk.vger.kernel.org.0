Well, we could expect the driver to never fail, and always be able to
calculate its rate (provided its parent is there). This is what this
patch is doing essentially, and it was working fine on a number of
platforms, so it doesn't seem unfeasible.

Either way, I'm not sure what your pushback is about here. Whether or
not the driver can or cannot return 0 on failure, that should be made
clear in the documentation, and for now it isn't.

If we want to maintain the status quo, then it means that recalc_rate
can return 0 on error, what's the harm in clearly stating that?

> Does the framework care that the rate couldn't be calculated?

I'd say to some extent, yes. The clk_set_rate_range() rework could just
ignore the call to clk_set_rate() if the current rate is 0. That would
have saved us from a couple of regressions.

Ok, so it's about the "must" part.

Yeah, maybe that's the best solution? I don't know, but the current
comment hints a bit at the "0 is an error" part with the reference to a
NULL clk.
