Hello Claude,

apologies for the extremely delayed reply...

The clocks we would like to adjust control ADC and DAC sample rates.  These rates do not change frequently, but depending on particular features we enable or on conditions that are specific to a certain customer there will be times where we will need to change sample rates. Our products have an extensive set of configuration parameters contained in json files that control many details of our signal processing chains.  Ideally we would like to add the ability to get/set clock rates through this mechanism.

I thought I would need to call the set_rate() method of the driver in order to change frequency.  If it is not too much trouble can you explain how I could change frequency via sysfs call?

You can't change the frequency using those sysfs interfaces. This is
because you are not supposed to change a frequency from userspace.

The reason is that a clock is not generally supposed to be used per se,
but rather to be consumed by another device (hence the name "consumer
driver"). Se my example about an audio codec.

Given the use case that you broadly described it looks like you need one
or another clock frequency based on some features that the consumer
device can optionally deliver. E.g. is you enable feature foo then it
will need a faster clock for the extra processing. If it is the case
then a proper way is probably to write your consumer driver to request
the clock it needs based on the enabled features:

  clk_set_rate(clk, feature_foo_is_enabled ? 2000000 : 1000000);

Does it make sense?
