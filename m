Doesn't:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-gpio/20230217075835.460-1-quic_kathirav@quicinc.com/
depend on:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20230217083308.12017-4-quic_kathirav@quicinc.com/
being merged first?

If you are going to resubmit the IPQ5332 baseport, please consider
sending one series with all the clock patches together.

You may send the dts separately, mentioning the dependency on the clock
series - or any other independent driver series that you sent out. That
way you make it easy for each maintainer to pick the patches destined
for their tree.

Bjorn
