Both the baseport[1] and APSS clock driver[2] series depends on the 
patch 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20230120082631.22053-1-quic_kathirav@quicinc.com/. 
GCC driver which is part of baseport uses the clk_alpha_pll_stromer_ops 
which is introduced in the mentioned patch.  However there is no 
dependency between baseport and APSS clock driver apart from DTS changes.

Thanks got it. In the next re-spin let me include the mentioned patch 
along with the baseport series.


Thanks, Kathiravan T.
