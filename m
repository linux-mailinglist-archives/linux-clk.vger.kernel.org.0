The KMS driver doesn't seem to have a problem with that.

You're confusing two things: the rate output by the hardware, and what
the CCF needs to return. We're discussing the latter here, a software
construct. It models the hardware, but it doesn't have to be true to the
hardware.

And even the meson driver doesn't follow what you're claiming to the
letter and is inconsistent with what you're saying. Any disabled gate
will also have a hardware rate of 0. Yet, it doesn't return 0 in such a
case. And no one does, because clk_get_rate() isn't supposed to return
the actual rate in hardware at the moment. It's supposed to return what
would be the rate if it was enabled.

I mean, I provided multiple examples that the meson driver is being
inconsistent with both the CCF documentation and the expected usage of
the CCF consumers. And I suggested solutions to fix this inconsistency
both here and on IRC to Neil and you.

The only argument you provided so far is that you don't like or want it.
I'm sorry you feel this way, but it doesn't change either the consensus
or the documentation that every other driver and consumer is following.
Nor does it provide any solution.

In the grand scheme of things, I don't care, if you want to have your
own conventions a policies, go ahead. Just don't expect me to debug
whatever is going on next time it falls apart.
