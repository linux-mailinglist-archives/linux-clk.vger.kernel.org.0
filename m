Yes, for the simplest example, we don't usually define 'int a =3D 1' in
header, we might just declare 'extern int a' in header files. If I
understand correctly, we are going to move all stuff in fu540-prci.c
into fu540-prci.h, so there will be many definitions of variable in
fu540-prci.h. These headers will be used only in one file (i.e.
sifive-prci.c), it might not cause strange behavior, but I'd like to
make sure if it could be accepted and ok to all you guys before I
sending the next version.
