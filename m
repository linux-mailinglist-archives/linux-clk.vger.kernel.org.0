Subject: [PATCH v2] dt-bindings: clk: Make example a bit clearer

From: Uwe Kleine-König <u.kleine-koenig@pengutronix.de>

Previously the example used <&pll 2> in two places which made it harder
than necessary to understand why this clock gets the parent of
<&clkcon 0>. Also describe why <&pll 2> isn't reparented and <&clkcon 0>
gets no rate assigned.

 Configuring a clock's parent and rate through the device node that consumes
 the clock can be done only for clocks that have a single user. Specifying
