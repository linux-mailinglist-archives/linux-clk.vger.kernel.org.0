Exactly why the DT maintainers annoyingly ask for specific compatible 
strings which may not be used immediately.

Your reasoning is the compatible string is unused, so remove it. 

If there's some reasoning about how the 2 panels are the same hardware 
or the rg353v is never going to be used or show up at some point, then 
that would be a reason to remove.

You could also say the rg353v is just wrong because it should have a 
fallback compatible to rg353p and rather than fix it, just remove it 
for now since there are no known users of it.
