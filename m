It's not only about changing the clock rate, but also about rounding the
rate and etc.

Besides, you won't be able to change the rate until provider is
registered, which might be a quite big problem by itself.

You absolutely have to have the ACTMON support if you want to provide a
good user experience because interconnect won't take into account the
dynamic CPU memory traffic. Without ACTMON support CPU will turn into a
"turtle" if memory runs on a lowest freq, while CPU needs the highest.

Secondly, the interconnect could underestimate the memory BW requirement
because memory performance depends quite a lot on the memory-accessing
patterns and it's not possible to predict it properly. Otherwise you may
need to always overestimate the BW, which perhaps is not what anyone
would really want to have.

I'm not sure why you're resisting to do it all properly from the start,
it looks to me that it will take you just a few lines of code (like in a
case of the T20/30 EMC).
