I see. 0xbb is the reset default, so as you said it is not set.

Ok, coherent with test 1.

So the values are picked up from DT and if you print the content of
clk_out->clk_output_cfg0[_mask] you should see the correct register values.

Now the relevant question is question 3: do you enter the
'if (hwdata->clk_output_cfg0_mask)' in vc5_clk_out_prepare()? Do you
even enter vc5_clk_out_prepare()?

You can add dev_dbg()s there and track the problem on your own. If
regmap_update_bits(...hwdata->clk_output_cfg0) is not called then the
code is not doing the right thing. If it is called and returns no error,
then it looks like there is a problem in the i2c controller which thinks
it has done the transaction but it really hasn't. Or some other mystery.
