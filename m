It's a pity. Tracking the pre-enabled clocks status would keep the
clock running till the driver is actually able to pick it up.

What about clk_get returning the clock and clk_enable transferring the
ownership?
I see that Michael Turquette had more or less the same ideas in 2015-2016.

It would ensure that the clock chain stays on till msm takes over the
efifb/splash/etc.

Could you please point me to it?
