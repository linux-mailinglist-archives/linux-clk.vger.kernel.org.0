The gist of their response is that this CPU is too old and so they don't
have much resources to spend time debugging things there any more. The
supporter suggested to upgrade to i.MX6 or i.MX7 instead ...

So we're living with the work around suggested in this thread and pray
it will continue to work for us even tough it doesn't seem to be robust
enough to fix the same problem for Stefan.
