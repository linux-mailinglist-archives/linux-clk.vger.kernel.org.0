Good catch! I can remove the part after the comma.

Not really any stronger guarantee. The guarantee is pretty strong
already though. You can look at the callers of dev_pm_domain_set() and
see that nothing is calling that really besides the genpd attachment
logic when a driver is bound to a device (follow dev_pm_domain_attach()
from platform_probe()). The dev->pm_domain is going to be assigned to a
genpd assuming the 'dev' pointer is a platform device and has
'power-domains' in DT.

It's not great, but it works for now. Certainly if we ever want to
replace the pm_domain with something that isn't a genpd then we'll be in
trouble. I'm not sure it will ever happen. Ulf, can you provide more
assurances here?

Cool!
