The problem is that we do NOT want this check for all i2c devices, so doing
it in any place other then the drivers means having some list of APCI-ids
to which to apply this someplace else. And then for every sensor driver
which needs this we need to update this list.

This is wht I've chosen to just put this check directly in the sensor
drivers. It is only 2 lines, it is a no-op on kernels where ACPI
is not enabled (without need a #ifdef) and it is a no-op if the
sensor i2c-client is not instantiated through APCI even when ACPI
support is enabled in the kernel.

I understand that you don't want a lot of ACPI specific code inside
the drivers, which is why I've come up with this fix which consists
of only 2 lines.  My previous attempts (which I never posted)
where much worse then this.

Regards,

Hans
