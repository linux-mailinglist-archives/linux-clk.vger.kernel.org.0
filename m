These clock generators are typically programmed through OTP because
(at least some of) the configuration is needed to boot the board.

Indeed. Except that here they can still be overwritten by software
later.

The latter is an inherent danger, and is probably the reason why Sean
wants to make it explicit: if the configuration is ever changed by
software, and the system is restarted without resetting the clock
generator (at least 5P49V6901A does not have a reset line), or using
kexec/kdump, the newly booted kernel does not know the intended
settings, and won't restore the correct configuration.

My issue was that these properties were introduced long after the
initial bindings, hence pre-existing DTS does not have them.
Yes, we can add them, but then we have to read out the OTP-programmed
settings first. If that's the way to go, I can look into that, though...

Thanks!
