And just to be clear these IPs can be combined with systems where the main cpu 
can be Microblaze. I have also seen some vendors mixing RISC-V with Xilinx IPs.

And I really thank you for this discussion to do it properly and have proper 
compatible string and description for this block.

Shubhrajyoti: please correct me if I am wrong.

All Xilinx SOCs have programmable logic aligned with FPGAs. Zynq is based 28nm,
ZynqMP (Ultrascale MPSOC) is based on 16nm and Versal is based on 7nm.

I think these clocking IPs are using low level primitives available in PL logic.
Which means there is connection to fpga/pl technology instead of SOC family and 
main cpu.
It can be of course said that if this is ZynqMP SOC that IP A is used. The same 
for Versal SOC. But for soft cores this can't be said.

Would it be better to reflect PL technology in compatible string?

xlnx,clocking-wizard-vX.X (used now for ZynqMP and previous families)
xlnx,clocking-wizard-7nm-vX.X (or find better name names which reflect PL logic 
type)

Thanks,
Michal
