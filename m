We will try to propose something for clk_hw_get_clk() soon.
If we do so, could we "UN-deprecate" clk_register() and make it a
wrapper around clk_hw_register() and clk_hw_get_clk() ?

It would make it easier on drivers which both register and use clocks.

To get a short term solution for Martin and his MMC driver:
-  If the above wrapper is OK and we commit on doing it soon, would you
   also be OK for martin to use clk_register() in his MMC driver (now) ?

-  If not, could we use clk_hw->clk until  we have clk_hw_get_clk() in
   CCF ?

Yes, I know it is your secret plan ... ;)
