Subject: [PATCH v3 0/9] clk: cs2000-cp: add dynamic mode and more features

This version of the patch series addresses typos in v2 and adds support
for dynamic mode, configurable clock skip settings and a tranisition to
regmap.

The most significant change is the additional support for dynamic mode.
Currently, the driver only supports static mode in which the (currently
mandatory) CLK_IN clock input is not used by the hardware. With patch
6/9 of this series, that clock is made optional now, and its presence is
used to determine the mode of operation.

Existing DTS users have dummy clock hacks in place and need to adopt to
this change. I have patches to do that which I intend to post once this
series is merged.

Rob, I left your Reviewed-by in 1/9 as that is untouched since v2. I'd
much appreciate a review of the other 3 patches that concern
dt-bindings.


Thanks,
Daniel
