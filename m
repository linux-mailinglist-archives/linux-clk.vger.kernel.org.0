many thanks for this reply, I was hoping for such a kind of report!
I typically don't test those things in anger, and only have a few
boards, so having those reports from the real world is very helpful!

Can you maybe give some hint on how you tested this? Does "at low core
voltages" mean you forced transitions between the lower OPPs only, or
were the chips undervolted?

Yes, I saw, I have added this to my A523 code already, and prepared a
patch for the H6.
Do you have boards with any other Allwinner SoCs you could test on, or
even already have experience with?

Cheers,
Andre
