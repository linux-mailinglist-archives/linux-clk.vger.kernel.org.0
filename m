It would be good to describe why. Or decide that it was an oversight and
write that down here.

I looked through the per-user constraint patch history on the list but I
couldn't really figure out why it was done this way. I guess we didn't
clamp the rate in the core because we wanted to give the clk providers
all the information, i.e. the rate that was requested and the boundaries
that the consumers have placed on the rate. With the round_rate() clk_op
the providers don't know the min/max because the rate request structure
isn't passed. I think my concern a long time ago was that a consumer
could call clk_round_rate() and get one frequency and then call
clk_set_rate() and get another frequency. We need to make sure that
round_rate and set_rate agree with each other. If we don't do that then
we don't uphold the contract that clk_round_rate() tells the consumer
what rate they'll get if they call clk_set_rate() with the same
frequency.

The comment says within range but this test says exactly the minimum
rate. Please change it to test that the rate is within rate 1 and rate
2. Also, we should call clk_get_rate() here to make sure the rate is
within the boundaries and matches what clk_round_rate() returned.

Same comment about within range.
