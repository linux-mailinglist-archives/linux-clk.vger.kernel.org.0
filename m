I probably didn't make myself clear enough here. ANY clock that is
enabled (HW-wise) before the kernel boots should remain AS IS, that is, no writing
the enable bit, no reparenting, and so on. This rule applies to the clock itself
and for all of its parents. This is because, for some clocks, writing the
enable bit might lead to glitches. UART is just one example. So, please, do not
try enabling such clocks until the consumer driver does so.

I think you lost me here. What do you mean by 'this'? If you mean the
enabling of orphan clocks, then the rule above still applies. It
doesn't matter if the clock is an orphan one or not. It can be orphan
from linux point of view, but the actual parent (even if it is not
registered with the linux clock tree) might still be enabled. This means
the clock itself will be also enabled. And by enabling them when
registering, we can have glitches. Therefore, please, do not do this
either.

The registering of a boot enabled clock should not change/override/touch
the current state of it in any way!

Stephen, can you confirm this as well?

I'm still not sure that defaulting to the clk_sync_state callback is a
good choice here. I have to think some more about what the impact is for
providers that do not have any sync_state callback registered currently.

Yep, tried that and it doesn't work. What happened was that, because you
were enabling the 'boot enabled' clocks when registering them (on __clk_core_init),
the disabling from the sync state needs to be without dropping the enable/prepare
counts. This is why I think my patchset here is the best alternative he have
currently, as it does exactly what it is supposed to do, namingly, to leave
untouched the boot enabled clocks until sync state and then disabling
them with via clk_disable_unused_subtree which calls the disable and
unprepare ops without decrementing the prepare and enable counts.

Well, I already did that and I described above why that won't help.
