PHY is indeed directly consuming CXO. That's why I included it in the binding.

No, I can assure that you got the wrong info. UFS PHY consumes the clock
directly from RPMh. It took me several days to dig through the UFS and PHY docs
and special thanks to Can Guo from UFS team, who provided much valuable
information about these clocks.

No, GCC_UFS_REF_CLKREF_CLK is _not_ the clock to UFS devices. I haven't found
information about this specific register in GCC. Initially I thought this is for
enabling QREF clocks for the UFS MEM phy, but I haven't found the answer yet.

But as I said earlier, reference clock to UFS devices comes directly from the
controller and there is a specfic register for controlling that. Starting from
SM8550, reference clock comes from RPMh.

Unfortunately, you got inaccurate information. But that's very common, since
these kind of info are buried down in some docs and people's mind :)
