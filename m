The main problem with adding flags doesn't fully scale. From the CCF
perspective, what should be the difference between parked and disabled
clocks? How should it treat the parked one?

From my point of view, the 'parked' clock is as good as 'disabled',
because the end devices do not work with the corresponding clock being
sourced from XO.
We already have a similar implementation for the PCIe PIPE clocks,
which reinterpret physical 'XO' source as a 'disabled' state to
facilitate disabling the clock before turning the genpd off.
