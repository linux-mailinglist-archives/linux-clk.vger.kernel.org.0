critical-clock property name is based on protected-clock property name.

There is also no CLK_IS_ALWAYS_ON flag , but there is CLK_IS_CRITICAL 
flag . Sure, there is no CLK_IS_PROTECTED flag because the protected 
clock is implemented only by a single driver (qualcomm).

I think it makes sense to align the DT property name and the flag name, 
and the critical-clock is aligned with both other DT property names in 
the clock framework and the flag name.
