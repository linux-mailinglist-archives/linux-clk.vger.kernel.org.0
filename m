T114/T124/T132/T210 all require it. T20/T30 I'm not sure since the TRM 
doesn't mention RAM repair, but that could just be missing 
documentation. I think it was introduced in T114 though. The T186 and 
T194s TRM mention RAM repair, but so much changed in those SoCs I'm not 
certain if it works in the same way and hence relies on fuse clock; 
probably though.
