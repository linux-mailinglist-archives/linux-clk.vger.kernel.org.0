Wouldn't this first set-and-forget configuration fit that bill? We can't
have a "base" driver because why?

I'd prefer we leave the SoC glue out of device drivers for subsystems
that really don't want to or need to know about the SoC level details.
The GPU driver wants to live life drawing triangles! :) It doesn't want
to know that the ACP path didn't work out on some SoC it got plopped
down into. And of course GPU is the only interested party, because the
SoC glue for the GPU is all messed up so GPU can't operate properly
without this bit toggled. I wonder where the fix would end up if this
port was shared by more than one driver. Probably back here in the
closest thing there is to the SoC driver.

It's not as simple as poking bits in some SoC glue IO space
unconditionally either. The GPU driver will need to know which SoC is
being used and then only poke the bits if the affected SoC is in use. Or
we'll have some DT binding update to poke the bit if some syscon
property is present in the DT node. Either way, it's a set-and-forget
thing, so the GPU driver will now have some set-and-forget logic for one
SoC out of many that it supports; do it once at boot, grab a regmap,
parse some more stuff to make sure it's needed, poke the bit, release
the regmap, finally start drawing.

Of course, I won't oppose the mess being moved somewhere outside of the
subsystem I maintain ;-) I was mainly curious to understand why the
regmap path is proposed.
