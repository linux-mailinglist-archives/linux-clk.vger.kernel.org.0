If a clock is parked and we get a request to change its rate, then the
old parent doesn't matter (as you say). But as we are done with the
set_rate the new parent will be turned off, as such as soon as we've
changed the parent we must park the RCG again.

So for parked shared_ops RCGs we simply remember the new configuration
of the set_rate until it's time to enable the RCG again.

As such I don't think that CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE adds any value (for the
shared_ops RCGs), only a bit of overhead.


That said, if I read the code correctly don't think we properly handles
a clk_set_parent() of a parked shared RCGs today...
