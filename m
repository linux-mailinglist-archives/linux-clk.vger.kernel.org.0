Since Rex is working on cleaning up the reset bits, maybe also coordinate
with him?

I don't think they use devres at the moment. They should, but I haven't
gotten that far with my improvements. *wink*

I agree with moving all the drivers off of CLK_OF_DECLARE() if possible.
There are definitely going to be a few ARM32 ones that can't be converted,
likely because they don't have the ARM arch timer, and need a clock
registered before the timers. Been there.

And there's a whole lot of work to be done for all the old drivers so that
they clean up after themselves.

My desire is to clean up the API (the naming and the parameters) so that
they more closely match up with the underlying CCF APIs they call. We can
then add devres variants (and of_ ones for the unfortunate platforms that
need them).

Yeah. I'll likely take up quite a bit of it after all my currently planned
cleanup work is done. Unless of course someone beats me to it.

Yes.
