Hi Stephen,

Thanks for your reviews :)

We won't modify either the pointer nor the clk_hw itself, so it made
sense to me?

Ok, I'll remove it.

I never know what to do here honestly. It's true that calling it with
NULL as a parameter seems dumb, but I could very well see a NULL pointer
stored in a variable and using that variable.

Preventing a NULL pointer dereference in such a case seems sane, but I
couldn't find a consistent policy in the kernel about what to do. I'll
remove it if you don't like it.

I'm sure we can come up with some coccinelle script if needed, but yeah
it's a pretty loose requirement for now.

Yeah, but it isn't the only issue, really.

Prior to this series, the most glaring issue is that most
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT handling is just updating the rate, or even just
copying the clk_request_rate and forwarding it to the parent:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/clk.c#L553

In this case, the requested rate is wrong, but the best_parent_hw and
best_parent_rate fields will be the one of the child clock, and thus
will point to the parent itself, not the parent's parent.

at91 has the same issue in multiple places:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/at91/clk-generat=
ed.c#L191
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/at91/clk-master.=
c#L402
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/at91/clk-master.=
c#L731

So making it available to drivers seems to add some value at least,
whether we require it or not.

Like I said, it's more of a symptom of a larger issue than a bug in
itself. It's not just that the driver doesn't enforce any boundary (so
at the clk_hw level), which would be fine, it's also that it will ignore
any user boundary, and that's where the bug is in my book. And it was
there prior to the patch you mentioned.

I'd be ok to add that kind of check for the time being, but it should at
least come with some kind of warning to report that something fishy is
going on and needs to be addressed.

The main user really will be a unit test I added for
__clk_determine_rate() to make sure the returned clk_request_rate is
sane. All the drivers we discussed so far would probably need to use
clk_core_forward_rate_req() instead.

If we follow what is being done for the rest of the clk_core_*
functions, clk_core_forward_rate_req() isn't available to providers and
isn't exported, to it would be difficult to use as is in the tests.
Could we create a clk_internal.h header or something maybe to export it
only to the tests if you don't want to expose it to drivers?
