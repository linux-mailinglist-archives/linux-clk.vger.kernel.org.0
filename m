I think I'm still confused about why we need negociate_rates in the
first place.

IIRC, Stephen's suggestion was something along the lines of "let's make
determine_rate optionally return a list of possible parent rates in
clk_rate_request and make the core find the intersection".

Why do we need to involve the driver in such a scenario, and using
negociate_rate in particular?

Yeah, discussing it at plumbers would probably be a good idea, and maybe
try to record / transcribe the meeting so we can have the minutes too
somewhere?
