It appears that this series breaks mmcc-msm8996:

[    8.713810] mmpll2_early: recalc_rate returned a null rate
[    8.713864] mmcc-msm8996: probe of 8c0000.clock-controller failed with e=
rror -22

I haven't yet tried to figure out the exact patch that causes
this or how it does. I just wanted to report it as soon as possible.
