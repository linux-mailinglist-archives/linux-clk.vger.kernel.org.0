Does it mean the clk-link topology in the downstream kernel can be
reused the same as normal clock notation?

For example, I'm trying to add HCLK_VO1 directly to VO1 syscon instead
of routing to pclk_vo1_grf(done downstream)
      vo1_grf: syscon@fd5a8000 {
               compatible = "rockchip,rk3588-vo-grf", "syscon";
               reg = <0x0 0xfd5a8000 0x0 0x100>;
             clocks = <&cru HCLK_VO1>;
      };

This seems breaking syscon for vo1_grf and observed a bus error while
accessing regmap. I remember in one of the RKDC discussion that the
double parenting of these clocks is mandatory while accessing
associated IP blocks. Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Jagan.
