Not sure what you mean by this. You have shown in your the commit
message that the DSI clocks make significant subtree. I don't see a
problem if you need to manage the root of that subtree. I'd be great if
you didn't need to, but it is what it is ...

You mentionned that the problem comes DSI bridges that needs to change
at runtime. I don't know much about those TBH, but is there
anyway you can come up with a static GP0 rate that would then be able to
divide to serve all the rates bridge would need in your use case ?

GP0 can go a lot higher than ~100MHz and there are dividers unused in the
tree it seems.

I suppose there is a finite number of required rate for each use case ?
If there are not too many and there is a common divider that allows a
common rate GP0 can do, it would solve your problem. It's a lot of if
but It is worth checking.

This is how audio works and DT assigned rate is a good match in this case.
