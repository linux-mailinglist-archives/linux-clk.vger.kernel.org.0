All I'm looking at mostly is to see if my Acked-by tag went away due to
changes, I might look at the rest of a series if I have time but if I've
checked the bit that's relevant to me I'm not going to worry too much
about the rest of it.

What I was suggesting was more just dropping the driver bits while the
MFD gets resolved, I'm never 100% sure why but the core MFD often takes
a long time to figure out as seems to be the case here.  There might be
as many individual resends overall but each maintainer will see fewer of
them.
