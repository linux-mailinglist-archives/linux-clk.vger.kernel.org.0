Sure, everything has a starting point somewhere, it just means more work 
for someone to have to do. I'm not that person - I'm just here as a 
curious reviewer asking questions to help refine the abstraction - so I 
chose to lean towards the pragmatic side here given what I know about 
how much Alyssa enjoys kernel development ;)

As I hoped to imply, I agree that that's a perfectly valid line of 
reasoning too. However it does gloss over certain other considerations 
like managing dependencies between the drivers such that it's not too 
cryptic for a user to configure a kernel that actually works as 
expected, and the GPU driver has a guarantee that the configuration 
really has been done by the point that it wants to start DMA, for instance.

In this case we do happen to have this handy function called 
panfrost_probe() which already deals with one-off startup stuff :P

We also already have SoC-specific GPU compatibles because even without 
experimental interconnect easter eggs, people integrate these IPs in 
fairly involved ways and there's a fair degree of variety. However 
unless we want to be super-strict it's also not too hard to simply 
assume that if we can find a "mediatek,mt8192-infracfg" syscon then we 
set the MT8192 magic bit within it, and if we can't then we don't.

Well, regmap because it's a syscon, so whoever's accessing it that 
should be via its existing regmap rather than going behind its back. To 
be fair, there is a nascent infracfg "driver" already (even if it's just 
two helper functions), so adding some new infrastructure in there is a 
clear possibility - the functionally-similar Rockchip GRF already has 
something comparable, for example - it's just somewhat more code and 
more work thinking through the additional reasoning, compared to piling 
SoC-specific GPU-related stuff into the place that already knows about 
SoC-specific GPU stuff. As things stand, if someone *is* prepared to 
take that on then it's fine by me!

FWIW, I have no desire to look more closely at the downstream driver, 
but I did notice in the context of the linked patch that there appeared 
to be some power-management-looking stuff as well as this magic bit, so 
if it's possible that that might be something we care about in future 
and mean we end up needing to poke syscons from Panfrost anyway, it 
might want factoring in to the decision.

Cheers,
Robin.
