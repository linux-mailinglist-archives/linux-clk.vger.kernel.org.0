The code will currently just return the configured rate when no provider
is available. It's going to always round to that one rate and it will
refuse to set another one. The EMC clock is basically going to function
as a fixed clock while no provider is attached.

Until the provider is registered, there's just no way to change the
rate. You always need to write MC and EMC registers in order to change
the rate, so trying to change it when the MC/EMC drivers aren't
available isn't going to work.

Can we not guess a bandwidth based on the CPU frequency? Yes, that's
perhaps going to be an overestimation if the CPU doesn't actually access
memory, but that's better than nothing at all.

Also, at this point I'm less worried about power consumption rather than
making Tegra210 devices perform useful tasks. Yes, eventually we'll want
to fine-tune power consumption, but it's going to take a bit of work to
get there. In the meantime, giving people a way to set an EMC frequency
other than that set on boot is going to make them very happy.

Overestimating might be a good starting point, though. At this point I'm
mostly concerned about being able to change the memory frequency at all
because many systems are mostly unusable at the boot EMC frequency.

Like I said, if ACTMON really does prove to be useful I'm all for adding
support on Tegra210, but I don't think trying to do everything all at
once is a very good plan. So I'm trying to get there in incremental
steps.

I'm not trying to resist anything. I'm just saying that all of the
issues that you're bringing up aren't an immediate concern.

My main concerns right now are to: a) allow people to change the EMC
frequency (and hopefully soon also allow the EMC frequency to be changed
based on bandwidth demands by memory client drivers) and b) not bloat
the kernel more than it has to (while my configuration isn't tweaked,
it's pretty standard and the resulting image is roughly 20 MiB; adding
the Tegra210 EMC driver adds another 64 KiB).

And if we really do want to add ACTMON support later on, you already
suggested a better way of moving forward, so it sounds to me like that
would be a nice incremental improvement, certainly much better than
bloating the kernel even further by requiring this to be built-in and
preventing it from being unloaded.
