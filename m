Subject: [PATCH RFC] dt-bindings: clk: fixed-mmio-clock: Document mapping MMIO values to clock rates

The 'fixed-mmio-clock' binding currently only allows for the fixed-rate
clock frequency to be read directly from the MMIO register.

There are, however, systems for which the value of a register uniquely
determines the frequency, but it is not encoded as a number in the
register. Rather the register may contain the latched values of the
strapping pins during system reset, and the clock rate can be determined
from the value of one strapping pin.

For example on Armada 37xx, the GPIO1[9] pin must be brough low or high
during system reset depending on whether the reference clock rate is
25 MHz or 40 MHz.

Extend this binding by adding two more properties:
- clock-rate-table-mask - if present, the register value will be masked
                          with the value of this property before mapping
- clock-rate-table - table mapping possible clock rates to register
                     values

This patch applies only after fixed-mmio-clock is converted to YAML by
  dt-bindings: clk: fixed-mmio-clock: Convert to YAML

This is a RFC and does not contain actual driver change. I would like
to hear your opinions.

The reason why I wrote this is that there are several clk drivers
reading one bit of a register and then registering fixed-rate clock
with frequency depending on that one bit. Most of them are drivers
also registering other clocks, but there is at least one,
armada-37xx-xtal, which only does this.

I think that systems where the reference clock can have different rates
and the rate is encoded into value of a strapping pin during reset
should describe these reference clocks in device tree with a table
mapping these possible rates to values of strapping pins.
