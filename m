Yes it's fine. Just the commit text reads as "If of_clk_init() is not
called in time_init() then nothing works" which is true but made me
wonder if it was because it needed to be super early or not. The commit
text could be a little clearer here.

We don't have any good solution for a fallback to call of_clk_init()
somewhere later. I do wonder if we should generalize this though and
call of_clk_init() from start_kernel() directly via some Kconfig that
architectures select if they need it for their timer and then move it to
an initcall if architectures don't select the config. Or throw it into
the of_platform_default_populate_init() hook if the architecture doesn't
need to call it early.
