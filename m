Hmm... Maybe the init function should be moved out of the clk_ops and
into the clk_init_data structure. It isn't used beyond registration time
anyway, so it may make sense to do that and decouple the clk_ops from
the controllers completely. Or we can have two init routines, one for
the software side and one for the hardware side, but that's probably
confusing. If anything, a clk hardware init function can be exported and
called from the clk software init function if needed.

Ok.

So if we moved the init function out of struct clk_ops it would work?
We could have helpers for the common paths, i.e. the device has the
regmap, or the syscon has the regmap, etc.

I get it. The difference in driver design while sharing the same clk
hardware and clk_ops causes this tension.

It doesn't work for early clocks that don't have a device.

I think you're saying that clk_ops can be common things that aren't
device/clk controller specific, while the regmap config is usually
device/clk controller specific. Furthermore, the name of the regmap is
also usually device/clk controller specific. The regmap assignment
doesn't really fit with the clk_ops because it's not operating on the
clk hardware like the other clk_ops all do.
