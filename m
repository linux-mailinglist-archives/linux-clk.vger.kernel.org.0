That was my conclusion as well. If we purposefully aren't enforcing some
*suggestions* of the common clock framework and our clocks don't play by th=
e
current rules then we need to reevaluate.

Kicked all involved parties on our end again. We'll see what the consensus =
is. I
have a feeling we're going to have to implement some horribly hacky selecti=
ve
caching solution to make everyone happy. I say horribly hacky because it wi=
ll
still have requirements about the ordering of particular calls that will ne=
ed to
be manually enforced in all corresponding drivers.

Well, this will be fun.
